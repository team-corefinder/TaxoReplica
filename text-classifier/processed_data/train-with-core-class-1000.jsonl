{"asin": "B005CLPP84", "reviewText": "This is our second Roku after getting an XD. The differences in the Roku 2 are: the cheapest is 720p wireless only, the next expensive is 1080p wireless only and the top of the line XS is 1080p wired/wireless with memory for games and a gaming remote. All use HDMI to connect to your TV. Our first was the Roku 2 XD, the middle of the line that is wireless with 1080p and it took only a week to decide to buy another. We use them daily. There is a good mixture of free and low cost content available to watch on them. HBO GO's addition means we no longer have to feel left out for having Satellite (Dish) and no On Demand like cable has. The same with EpixHD, we have Dish Network and subscribe to Epix so we have access to their movies and even the channel live on the Roku 2. Crackle is a free channel on the Roku, owned by Sony it features uncut movies from DVD to HD quality. The biggest reason we got the Roku was to access Amazon Prime HD movies, you can't do that on the web via a computer, they are only in SD. Of course Hulu Plus and NetFlix are also included channels on the Roku.Because one of our TVs didn't have enough HDMI inputs, I got an inexpensive HDMI switch. The one I got was like this one, Ultra High Performance HDMI Switcher, 3to1 SwitchProsGreat content, increasing all the time...recently HBO GO was added, check their website for current lineupLots of free contentLots of low cost contentVery small sizeEasy to installGreat Customer ServiceDepending on the Roku channel/your internet service, great picture qualityConsYou have to have a decent internet connection to get the most of it. Although it will lower theresolution of the picture for slower connections. I would think a 3.0 mbps connection would be fine. To stream the highest level of HD Netflix, you need a 9mbps connection, like you need for the top VuDu offerings.Not all channels have closed captionsSome Internet providers have data caps and you could run overTo upgrade one of the lower models to gaming, the remote and memory card are $30, pricy.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Streaming Media Players"], "core_classes": [["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video"], ["root", "Electronics", "Electronics Warranties"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Television Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Streaming Media Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Portable DVD Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Portable & Novelty TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Satellite Dishes"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Stands"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Remote Controls"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "FM Transmitters"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Speaker Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Cases"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Docking Stations"]]}

{"asin": "B00576APEI", "reviewText": "I would have been disappointed with this at the original price, but at the new sales price it's a bargain for those who travel or who want to have a central source of data that multiple users can access. I've used this on a new iPad, a Google Nexus GSM phone and a Samsung Tab 7 Plus and it has worked flawlessly with each of them.  With players that don't have expandable storage like Apple or some newer tablets like the Fire and Nexus the need for this is obvious. You either use something like this or you will constantly be shuffling content on the unit itself.  This is even handy for products that have expandable storage because if you have multiple gadgets like I do you can just keep music and movies here and not mess with keeping them organized in multiple units.  The ability to have the data such as movies or tv shows accessed simultaneously by 2 or 3 persons who can each be watching different shows stored on it makes it perfect for, for example, having kids able to watch what they want in the back of the car during a drive. Like anything else it does have a few drawbacks:1. It runs a bit warm. Doesn't seem to be harming anything, but I just hate to see electronic items running warm.2. The case is an absolute fingerprint magnet. If you even look at it you'll have prints on it. Glossy black looks nice, but is impossible to keep clean.3. The instructions are so-so, a bit hard to understand.4. This is a one way transfer, you can't download content from your unit to the drive for, for example, downloading pictures from your phone to the drive. This should not be the fault of the unit, but It seems to be what people expect so it's a good idea to stress that it won't do this.5. Although the instructions on how to do this are not clear, it is actually quite easy to use this aAlong with another external wifi network and to secure it. Again, not the fault of he unit but many people seemed to not be aware that it can be done.I'm sure that this item is being discontinued since the price is so low, and maybe the new version will allow you to add additional storage with microSD cards, but at the current price the WiDrive is a great deal and a great tool to have.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage"], "core_classes": [["root", "Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Marine Electronics"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Modern, 20th, & 21st Century"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Renaissance (c.1450-1600)"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage", "Network Attached Storage"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage", "External Zip Drives"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Computer Cases"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "Optical Drives"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "KVM Switches"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Memory"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Network Cards"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "I/O Port Cards"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Installation Services"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Safety & Security"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "External Sound Cards"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Audio & Video Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Video"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "External TV Tuners"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Radar Detectors"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Car Dash Mounting Kits"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Marine Electronics", "Marine Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Aviation Electronics", "Aviation Charts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "Optical Drives", "CD Drives"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Digital Media Player Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "I/O Port Cards", "RAID Controllers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Internal Optical Drives", "Internal CD Drives"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Video", "Overhead Video"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Amplifier Installation"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Digital Media Receivers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Equalizers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Satellite Radio"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Speakers", "Component Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Speakers", "Kick-Panel Enclosures"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Speaker Installation", "Speaker Connectors"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Speakers", "Tweeters"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Speakers", "Coaxial Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Subwoofers", "Component Subwoofers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics", "Car Audio", "Subwoofers", "Subwoofer Boxes and Enclosures"]]}

As anyone who has messed with memory foam knows, this was a bit of a pain to get on the bed and especially work with the cover. Once it was on and I was sleeping on it, well that is another story. The mini documentation mentions it can take a while to get used to a topper, and I've had this for a few weeks now. I don't sleep especially well on a regular basis, and sometimes it can take me hours to get to sleep without a little help.  It did take some getting used to, and while in the winter occasionally lower back pain creeps up on me because of the cold, it hasn't happened so far. I really think it is thank to the memory foam which keeps me comfortable and in place. I like the general level of coziness I have while sleeping and also while sitting up and reading or just kind of relaxing and watching a little TV. The only negative I can say about this topper is that it's a tad more difficult getting out of bed. Before I could sort of bounce out of bed, slap the alarm and get going. The memory foam kind of holds me in place now so it's a bit more of dragging myself off the bed, a slower but miniscule process. I also wonder how awesome this would be if it were thicker.

{"asin": "B00ET9YYS2", "reviewText": "(Full Disclosure: I received this case as a beta tester from New Trent.  The opinions are my own and are not influenced in any way by New Trent).If you are looking for a keyboard case that does a convincing job of converting your iPad Air into a mini-laptop, this is one case to consider.  The case is built so that you can open it up like a laptop, and the flexible hing mechanism allows for both landscape and portrait orientation, and multiple degrees of incline so you can adjust the angle to the iPad to your liking.  As far as I know, this is the most flexible keyboard case out there.  What is also great is for the times you do not want to use the keyboard, the case covering the back half of the iPad can be detached, and you end up with a good plastic shell protecting the back of your iPad.

{"asin": "B000002B35", "reviewText": "This 1995 live set simply kicks Delicate Sound Of Thunder's butt in documenting live Pink Floyd.  The songs performed here try to stay true to their studio originals.  As with the previous live set, this one also has a video version.  It was recorded in October 1994 at Earls Court in London in support of the Division Bell album.  There is also a complete live performance of Pink Floyd's best-seller The Dark Side Of The Moon which is the highlight of the whole set.  The songs from the classic 1973 release stay to original form.  Another highlight is Comfortably Numb in which David Gilmour probably does his best guitar work ever.  The band members here feel more united than ever before doing their best work without having to contend with Roger Waters.  The feud with Waters during their late-1980's tour probably marred their live performance as documented on Delicate Sound Of Thunder.  Not here.  This is pure, unadulterated live Pink Floyd.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], "core_classes": [["root", "Rock"], ["root", "Rock", "Live Albums"], ["root", "Rock", "Rock Guitarists"]]}

It's the first in this series but it pulls heavily from the Hell or High Water series. While you certainly don't have to read those books first, I highly recommend it just so you can truly understand all the nuances of what all is happening in this one.This is an interesting story because throughout the book, the two main characters spend very little time actually together. Most of the relationship is conducted through the computer where one of the characters doesn't have any idea what is actually going on. It's flirty, it's fun, it's super-sexy and hot. I even laughed out loud several times throughout the story. Overall I probably would have given the book a B+, but then the end happened...OMG!And this book went from, &#34;Hey, this is a fun read...&#34; to &#34;OMG, wtf just happened and how did I not see that coming?&#34;I've read a lot of cliffhangers and a lot of shocker story lines, but I don't think I've in my life read one as well done as this one.SE Jakes, you are a sadistic wench.She now has the top spot for authors I love to hate because of the twists and turns she weaves.

{"asin": "B000WMEEC6", "reviewText": "I remember back in 1996 when I owned Civilization 2 for the PC. I recall all the countless hours I spent in front of the computer playing this game. It was nothing spectacular visually or even in the sound department. It was just the concept. Owning your own civilization from the caveman days to the year 2020 is just an amazing concept. It's my favorite game!!!Furthermore, the way game designer Sid Meier put it together was just incredible and done in a way that made the game very addicting. I had purchased his Pirates! game for the Amiga computer circa 1990 and I thought this title was somewhat superior to that one. In fact, it may have been the best game I've ever played although I do admit it might not be for everyone.I won't go into detail about comparing this latest portable Civ title to the one on the PC I had in '96, but it does offer a solid playing experience. It was put together very well, although it lacks the good music I remember. It is also devoid of the civilization encyclopedia which kind of breaks my heart. The graphics are nothing special and the game map is in 2d. I feel as though there should have been a theme song playing that changed each time you advanced into a new era representing the era you're in. Like going from tribal drums in 4000 bc to techno music in modern day. I gather they couldn't fit all that content into one cart but I forgive them as the game plays great and much faster. It's very deep and involving. It may even be the best one I have on the DS. Why?? It's not how attractive you are, it's how much fun you are to be with. I love this game!Footnote for Sid and 2k;If you're reading this; I feel as though this game would be a little more suited to the PSP as you probably would be able to add those things I had mentioned being UMD's can hold more info. Also, I think the bigger screen of the PSP would help as they would allow for bigger maps and perhaps a map editor. Ironically, your other remake Pirates! would be more suited to the DS as you could have the map of the Carribean on one screen and game-play on the other. Although I'm not a big fan of the stylus game-play, I believe it would be suited more to Pirates! as you could maybe pin-point the towns you'd like to sail to or jot down extra notes in your log. These are just suggestions if you are in the process of making any re-makes or sequels of these two games. You are the best in the business!

I was going back and forth a lot between this and the Touch Cover 2. I ended up buying the touch one at first but I started to hate it after 2 weeks. I was able to use it fine for browsing or small tasks but when I had to write papers for class, it was a nightmare. I made a lot of mistakes and it is hard to type when you can't tell if you pressed a key. This Type Cover 2 is almost perfect. It is smaller than a normal keyboard but after a week I couldn't tell the difference. They keys are quiet and soft to press. The trackpad is not that good as many people have pointed out but you won't use it much because you can touch and use a pen. It is usable but just too sensative. This is the best keyboard for now until the next release.The backlight feature is great for night time. This is fairly thin and light enough to carry it around with the surface pro 2.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Laptop & Netbook Computer Accessories"], "core_classes":

{"asin": "B00BSBR0BW", "reviewText": "3.5-4 starsThis was a pretty good story. I liked Bonnie and Will and enjoyed their story.Bonnie works for the Kentucky Commission of Tourism traveling around the state working on projects. She's enjoyed this and the work she does but finds that she's wanting to get off the road. Her travelling doesn't give her much of a personal life (for friends or more) and she's asked her boss for an office position but at this point things don't look likely. Bonnie realizes that she'll really have to impress her boss to get a chance at what she wants. She's sent to Mud Creek, KY to pull all the items of historical value out of McBride&#8217;s Music Hall before it's demolished and she's hoping this might be the chance she needs to impress her boss. Unfortunately, things start going wrong as soon as she hits the town limits of Mud Creek, starting with her car catching on fire.Will is the Mayor of Mud Creek and trying very hard to help his community. There isn't much work but he has the chance for a manufacturing plant to be built that will bring in much needed jobs (it's this plant construction that's bringing about the demolition of McBride&#8217;s Music Hall. Will is the grandson of the man that built McBride&#8217;s Music Hall but his memories of the place aren't great and he's more than willing to see it go if it'll bring much needed jobs to their town. He doesn't intend to let anything get in his way but he wasn't expecting the complications that show up when Bonnie comes to town.When Will and Bonnie meet, her car is on fire and Will helps her save her belongings from her car before it's consumed. There's an attraction between them from the start and this complicates things when she finds out that he's the Mayor. Will's charming but Bonnie tries to keep things professional and doesn't give in to his charms easily. They strike up a friendship and work together well as she starts working on the Music Hall. Things start getting difficult when she finds that the music hall has true historical significance and she wants to preserve it as a museum. Knowing the city is counting on the plant being built, she plans to try to gain sponsors and funding to have the building moved to some nearby land and then restore it. Things go off the rail when Will finds out about the plan and (not really caring that she intends to move it and isn't trying to mess with the plant) acts out against Bonnie nastily, his actions tarnish her reputation, almost ruins her career and makes her hated in town.Bonnie understands Will's freak out but his actions killed the progress she'd made and she has to start all over. She works on getting the museum funding for the building move and the renovations and despite very few people in town giving her the time of day, she goes out of her way to help the town out in other ways. Her and Will have a strained time and it's a while before they are talking again. They do straighten things out to an extent but the project is still an issue. Bonnie makes some bold moves and ends up being able to get the funding she needs for the move of the music hall and gets the plant being built back on track. Everyone is happy and things seem to be good with Will but then as the project come to a close Will starts pulling back. Bonnie gets her promotion and ends up going home to start her new job but misses Will. Fortunately, Will does pull his head out (of you know where) and goes after her. We end the story with a nice start to their HEA.This was a pretty good story. I liked the Bonnie and Will and well as the secondary characters. To be honest it's a similar tone to the first book in the series so if you liked that one you'll probably like this one. I'd recommend it for someone looking for a light, humorous read.* note - I listened to the audio version of this book. The narrator, Amanda Ronconi does a great job as always.", "categories": ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Contemporary"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root",

But, if your plan is to write full-time and you're persistent, committed, and organized, this book by John Allen clearly outlines the specific process that you should follow in order to write 2 solid ebooks each week.I honestly wasn't expecting to learn anything in this short book, but it's packed with actionable information on every single page. It offers suggestions, schedules, and research ideas.There are no affiliate links and no fluff.What I really like is that the author doesn't try to tell you that his plan is for everyone. He specifically states what group of people should be able to accomplish what he has accomplished and he tells you exactly how he was able to do so.Good stuff.Having said that I do find 1 thing confusing: The author states that he's written more than 100 kindle ebooks, yet I'm only able to find 2 of them under his name. If he's written them under a pen name, that's fine, I just think he should mention that in the book, and maybe even speak to WHY he does so.", "categories": ["Books", "Reference", "Writing, Research & Publishing Guides"], "core_classes": [["root", "Folk"]]}

{"asin": "B003JQLI9O", "reviewText": "I am familiar with the Blu-ray players out there that have integrated Netflix streaming, as well as Pandora and the like. So when I reviewed this product, I certainly had this in mind. Moreover, if I am going to have a blu-ray player, a HD receiver (cable box), surround sound, maybe video games and any other accessories, this box will have to pull its on weight. It will have to do something the others do not, and do it well.Does this warrant a spot in your entertainment hub? Read on to find out.So you have read the description of this product, and if you are in the market for this thing, I am sure you know of other products that purport to do the same thing.Does this stream Netflix? Yes, 1080p quality too, which means that if the video you are watching is capable of 1080p, this will stream it. I found that the quality of the stream is in direct relation to the type of internet connection you have. So, if you went cheap on the net box, you will be given a cheapened picture. There is nothing special about the way it streams the films, and the other separating factor between this and other devices is, I have to assume, the 1080p because I have not seen that advertised in the products I have previously used. It also comes with a free HDMI cable as well as A/V (Red, Yellow, White) so that if you do not have an HD TV, you can still play this on older models. The display, of course, can be set to NTSC 4:3 instead of 16:9, so it does integrated well with most models of television.Does is have an integrated internet browser? Yes, but a slow one. It takes a while to load pages, and in order to type text into anything on the webspace, you will have to use your remote (which features a numeric/letter keypad much like the old phones we use to have). Checking Facebook, your email, and even twitter is a chore to experience for the letters are very small and almost unreadable, and the overall quality is lacking.LOOK:The interface itself is on the same level as an older Blackberry phone. They have icons, which are pixelated (grainy), on a scroll menu at the very top of the screen. It is simple to manage through, but the overall look is not too pretty.STARTUP:On startup, it usually takes around 15 seconds to get ready and connected so that you can use the product.INTERNET:Also, to use this thing at all really, you have to be connected to the internet. And by connection, I mean that it either has to be directly wired into a router/modem, or it receive a signal wirelessly. However, it does not have a built in Wi-Fi which means if you want to use this device with a Wi-Fi connection, you will have to purchase a seperate USB dongle. For me, this was an annoyance because 1. I do not want to purchase an additional item for this to work the way I want (which is wireless) and 2. I do not want to add one more wire that I will somehow have to abscond into the shadows with the others. I wanted this to have a built in WiFi card at least, but it does not.Why is this one different then the other products out there then? I do not think it is so much as to warrant a direct purchase if you do not already have a device similar to this. If 1080p is the deciding factor here, and other devices (such as your Blu-ray player) does not feature that, then I guess that would make this product for you. Me? I have to say paying a little extra for a Nintendo Wii, with a smoother browser, a quicker startup time, more features, and a more viewer friendly YouTube and Netflix interface and stream would be more auspicious to those in the market for a media system/player.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Home Audio", "Radios"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root",

{"asin": "B000065DVB", "reviewText": "I bought this album out of blind faith, having only heard &quot;Not Afraid,&quot; and a little clip of &quot;Get Away.&quot;  I normally wouldn't do that, but it was on sale for 8$, so i figured, why not?  Well, I know I would have paid the full retail price for this album, because it is well worth it.  Earshot is a great band.  They are a great up-coming Nu-metal/Alt. Rock Band.  I definatley want to hear more from them in the future, and I heard they're working on a new album, so I can't wait for that.Now I'm still confused why people say they sound like TooL?  The same thing happened with many other bands as well.&quot;Hoobastank sounds like Incubus.&quot;&quot;Adema is sounds Korn.&quot;&quot;Bush is copying Nirvana.&quot;&quot;Earshot is ripping off of TooL.&quot;Etc.Now, if you notice something, all the bands that supposedly &quot;Copying&quot; the sound of another, happen to all be MUCH better than the band they're supposedly ripping off.  Hoobastank is much better that Incubus, Adema is much better than Korn, Bush is way better than Nirvana, and, that's right people, Earshot is far superior to TooL.  All these bands take basis in the band they're supposedly &quot;copying,&quot; and add many other influences, and much them into a superior band.  Earshot has roots in TooL, but there is also many other influences.  In a lot of the songs you can hear Linkin Park Influences, sometimes Korn influeces, and a lot else.  Earshot is not copying TooL, they just have some roots in TooL. Are they TooL?  Not at all.  Get something better to complain about, like bands that actually do sound alike.  Like every pop-band on the market.1. &quot;Headstrong.&quot;(10/10) It's hard to say which is my favorite song on this album between &quot;Headstrong&quot; and &quot;Not Afraid.&quot;  I'll say it's &quot;Headstrong&quot; though.  &quot;Headstrong&quot; is a strangley melodic lovely song with hard rocking guitars with some intresting other things.  &quot;Headstrong&quot; is the perfect introduction to Earshot.  It is the song I would say describes Earshot.  Hard, soft, and stragnley melodic.2. &quot;Misery&quot; (8.5/10) This song has to grow on you before you can actually enjoy it.  After a couple times listening, it's actually pretty catchy, and you can see the quality of the song writing of Earshot.  Wil's voice is really amazing on this song as well.3. &quot;Get Away&quot; (9.5/10)  Probably the song most people know Earshot by.  It's a great song, with a nice catchy chours, and it's very well written.  It's a great song.4. &quot;Not Afraid&quot; (10/10) The first Earshot song I heard, and it's still one of my favorites. This is the most melodic song on the album.  It goes from really soft, to a nice hard rocking chours that has some really low tuned guitars.  Amazing5. &quot;Ordinary Girl&quot; (9/10) This song reminds me a lot of &quot;This World,&quot; But it's better than &quot;This World.&quot;  It's a great catchy balad, but it's not my favorite song. It's a nice song, but it's not quite as catchy as some of the other Earshot songs.6. &quot;We Fall, We stand&quot; (9.5/10) This song has the best introduction of all the songs on the album.  The bass player for Earshot really has some skill.  The chours is amazingly catchy.  It's hard to describe this song.  The chours is written very well, and you can see what work was put into this song.  You have to hear this one for yourself.7. &quot;Wake up&quot; (9/10) One of the strangest songs on the album.  It's a softer song.  The chours is really wierd though, it has some &quot;anti&quot; melodical parts, and then when Wil sings &quot;Wake, Up!&quot; it becomes strangley melodic.  My favorite part of this song is the dropping vocals.  I believe this is the only song that has profanity in it.  Don't let that turn you away from Earshot though.8. &quot;This World&quot; (8/10) My least favorite song on the whole album.  It's starts out with the verse right away with distortion and everything, but the chours isn't too good the first time, but it gets better and and better as the song goes on.  For being my least favorite song on the album, it's still very amazing.9. &quot;Asleep I Lie&quot; (9.5/10) This song's chours reminds me of Linkin Park's &quot;Papercut.&quot;  The verses are strangley melodic, and not melodic at the same time. Then it blasts into the amazing chours, that is definatley one of the catchiest chourses on the whole album.  Totally amazing.  You have to hear this song for yourself.10. &quot;Unfortunate.&quot;  (9/10) Definatley one of the wierdest songs on the album.  The chours seems to be &quot;Anti-melodical,&quot; and &quot;Melodical&quot; at the same time.  This song is definatley a softer song, and one of the longer ones.11. &quot;This time&quot; (8/10)  This song is good, but not the best on the album at all.  The chours is strangley catchy, which doesn't make sense, because it's so out of timing, but yet it's still catchy.  That's some quality Earshot song writing.  This song is confusing, though I think it means (in my opinion) is about searching for religion, but I really don't know.  It's one of harder songs on the album to get into, but it's still pretty good none-the-less.If you don't have this album, you probably are somehow mentally handicapped.

{"asin": "B000005HM9", "reviewText": "Iced Earth's third album released in 1995 \"Burnt Offerings\" is without question one of the best heavy metal albums to be ever released in the 90's, as well as Iced Earth's most darkest and heaviest, and absolute best album ever hands down. While the band's first two albums, their 1990 self titled album (which featured Gene Adam on vocals) and 1991's \"Night of the Stormrider\" (which featured John Greely on vocals) were both excellent albums in their own rights, however \"Burnt Offerings\" is much more darker, heavier, meaner, aggressive, and more epic, filled with hard-edged vocals, lethal, fiery, neck-breaking riffs and dazzling solos, killer drum work, plenty of keyboards for texture, awesome song structures, and brilliant songwriting all in one monstrous package. Another thing I'd like to point out is that \"Burnt Offerings\" is also the first Iced Earth release to feature vocalist Matthew Barlow as well. Now words just cannot even describe how amazingly incredible Barlow's vocals are. He is truly one of the greatest metal singers ever, and he's also considered as Iced Earth's finest and most celebrated lead singer as well. Barlow's convincingly skilled and talented vocal style on here consists of amazing melodic power metal-like singing, harsh and lethal snarling and growling, and killer high pitched wailing screams reminiscent of Rob Halford of Judas Priest fame. There's simply no question that Barlow really adds so much passion and emotion to the music on this album. Rhythm guitarist and main songwriter Jon Schaffer does such a great job at driving each track throughout with his heavy, fiery, metallic, thrashing, and neck-breaking riffing while lead shredder Randy Shawver delivers some amazingly jaw-dropping leads and solos, and bassist Dave Abell and drummer Rodney Beasley both do a great job at providing an awesome rhythm section as well, specifically Beasley in particular who just muscles his way flawlessly throughout with his excellent double bass drumming.The Songs:The opening tile track \"Burnt Offerings\" is an amazing opener, and it's also my personal favorite Iced Earth song next to the 16+ minute epic closer \"Dante's Inferno\". It starts off with a haunting Exorcist-like keyboard intro and then the song explodes into an inferno of dark, evil, fiery, heavy neck-breaking riffs that are played in a symphonic rhythm, plus fierce and aggressive vocals from Barlow, and pummeling double bass patterns and hefty, thumping beats, and we also have an awesome chorus as well. The fiery onslaught of this song continues on until the 3:47 mark when it slows down into a haunting yet wonderful melodic breakdown which includes some brilliant melodic sung vocals and eerie acoustic guitar until the heaviness resumes at 5:37 with a mad, jaw-dropping guitar solo before rounding off the song with the awesome chorus a few time over until the song fades out making way for the next track. Next up, we have \"Last December\" which begins with some beautiful acoustic guitars and melodic vocals, and then thrusts into some catchy, heavy riffing. There's also some awesome melodic guitar leads and fierce, soaring vocals as well. Other highlights here on \"Burnt Offerings\" include \"Diary\" which features crunchy, chunky riffs and muscular drumming, as well as \"Brainwashed\" which is highlighted by an acoustic intro that leads into a nice thrashing groove and later by more fiery, thrashing riffs plus more muscular drumming from Beasley, and there's also a great guitar solo as well. Track five \"Burning Oasis\" is another one of my favorites that features some killer Halford-esque wails from Barlow, as well as some great drumming near the end, while track six \"Creator Failure\" features heavy, brutal riffing, plus another awesome solo, as well as more high pitched Halford-like wails near the end. Another favorite of mine, track seven \"The Pierced Spirit\" is a short yet beautifully melodic and sorrowful cut that features emotional and sorrowful vocals over an interplay of piano and acoustic guitar which both work so well together. It really sets the tone for the culmination and of course the cornerstone of this album, that of course being the 16+ minute epic monster of a masterpiece \"Dante's Inferno\" which takes the listener on a hellaciously breathtaking musical journey through the nine plains of Hell. This song truly has it all: Amazing vocals including some demonic vocal parts, blistering, thrashy, energetic riffs and fiery leads and solos, lush keyboards, awesome, intense double bass drumming, seriously this song is truly a beast. It is definitely one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever, and of course the greatest Iced Earth song ever in my humble opinion as well. Not a single word can even describe how incredible it is, you really have to listen to it for yourself.Conclusion:So in conclusion folks, there is simply no question that \"Burnt Offerings\" is Iced Earth's most darkest, meanest, heaviest, and most importantly their absolute best album hands down in my humble opinion, and I'm very proud to say that it is also my personal favorite Iced Earth album as well. The Century Media re-release version of this CD which I have here is just absolutely awesome thanks to it's wonderfully clear production. Bottom line, \"Burnt Offerings\" is a true and pure heavy metal masterpiece on so many countless levels, so if you're a serious metalhead, then by all means, this album is a serious must have in your metal CD collection...Highly Recommended!!!HORNS UP!!!", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal", "Pop Metal"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books", "Travel"],

He may have taken a step back in an attempt to expand his audience.  Regardless of the comparison's made to Mike and the Mechanics, I like Wave on Wave (which makes sense if you believe the comparisons, because I also like Mike and the Mechanics).  I purchased the album on the strength of Wave on Wave and on recommendations from a Texas friend that really enjoys Pat Green's music.  I was a little disappointed.  Out of the 13 songs on the record I only really enjoyed three.  Wave on Wave, of course was the first.  Then I liked All the Good Things Fade Away, which to me was a bit of the Grateful Dead meets Charlie Daniels, but hey I like hearing it.  Finally Run is a nice mellow song to listen to.  Pat Green has a strong voice that is clear and easy to listen too.  I just think that his other albums were of better quality.

This problem cannot be blame on my computer as both windows media player and winamp work perfectly.Also the itunes software is not intuative. It took me five minutes to figure out how to get mp3s that were on my laptop onto the nano and I'm still not sure exactly what I did to get the files to load on the nano. Guess I'll have to ask my daughter.I was also disapointed by the lack of a case. Steve Jobs is ripping off his customers. It wouldn't have cost Apple $0.25 to have included a small cloth bag to keep the nano in or for $0.50 they could have included a plastic case. Guess I'll have to build the altiod case that I saw in a ipod forum till real cases become available.There also is no clip. This is a real short coming as the nano is so small that it will easily slip out of your pocket and there is no good way to keep your nano secure when using while working out at the gym.That said the nano is a 10, no question.

{"asin": "B009JAHJR4", "reviewText": "A totally, captivating, and powerfully potent suspense thriller. The book is cleverly written with the emotions, lives and outcomes of all the main characters, interpreted and told through the eyes of the books' main character, Pearl Zhang, the story sucks you in immediately.We are introduced to the main character Pearl Zhang, a Mandarin Language Interpreter working with law enforcement and social service agencies in the United Kingdom. Pearl's life is at a crossroads on professional and personal levels. Forced out of her previous successful career, Pearl has launched a new career for herself working closely with these agencies, all the while she is dealing with the pain of being recently separated from the love of her life, Husband Andrew.Pearl's separation, loneliness and self-doubts lead her into the arms of Detective Inspector Jack Gordon, a former military hero, but a similarly work obsessed character. Their steamy and seductive chemistry is only outdone by their own self doubts and loneliness, sharply brought into contrast, with the dramatic and sometimes graphic stories of the other characters in the book.Kirk, uses Pearl's character to narrate the story, and introduces the reader to the dark and painful world of human trafficking, where individual stories are sometimes heartbreaking and often frustrating in their outcomes, as public and private agencies fight, often valiantly, but often with little or no useful result, to help men, women, and children who have been kidnapped, tricked, or forced by violence; into a world they never wanted or can handle. Passionate and committed to her work, Pearl finds her involvement with these human stories intensely personal and leads her to question the motivations and morality of the Snakeheads(Traffickers), and how they can subject innocent helpless people, to such brutal and horrific treatment on every level.Kirk, does a wonderful job of developing the book's characters, showing the reader increasingly significant cracks in Pearl's thoughts and feelings, the more she delves into the fascinating cast of characters created by the author. Pearl's interaction and sense of personal responsibility and commitment for the truth, and assisting these helpless people sometimes; creates situations of powerful over-dependence by each character on Pearl, beyond her professional instincts.It is often this mental and emotional battle between her professional role, and her personal moral and emotional uncertainty that provides; the most unexpected and shocking of consequences for the book's characters and indeed, Pearl herself. The author has taken a very complex and challenging modern issue, and expertly treated it with a clear compassion and detailed understanding, enabling the reader to discover harsh realities of the brutal and often little addressed issue of human trafficking.It is a book of extremes with characters of ultra confidence and manipulative brilliance, through to the petrified characters often deeply emotionally troubled, due to the nature of their experiences and life's reflections. The book contains many frightening, unfortunate, and true messages, told with imaginative twists and turns.We often read fictional thrillers in the pursuit and desire for escapism for ourselves however; by the time the reader is introduced to each character and personal story, you will find yourself egging on the vulnerable to succeed in their desire to escape and seek a better life.Money being the root of all evils, the irony is that the evil incarcerators and those incarcerated is their need to fulfil one common desire - earn money. The author captures this forcefully when using Deng Xiao Ping's quote, `Getting Rich is Glorious'.  Glorious for those who have it, and glorious for those who may get it, due to the dreadful life they would escape.Each personal story in the book is absorbing and testimony to the author's knowledge of the subject matter and intelligent writing. Each person, like all immigrants believe \"The Land of Hope\" in Europe, Japan or the USA will be the answer to their problems. Too often immigrants only realise that the life they left behind, was in many ways, better then the life they now find themselves exposed to. They can only think pleasant things in their dreams and hold onto the happiness of home in their hearts, not their day to day reality.The book is absorbing, cleverly written, and fast-paced style throughout with an informative and educational element driven by great characters. The book is powerful in its culmination with an action packed yet, heart tugging ending. It leaves the reader considering this very real world issue and yet, the characters are so credible, you are left wondering if there is an Ah Fang, Madam Lin or even a Dragon in your locality.One final note, at the outset of the book, the author provides a very useful guide to Chinese names, to assist the reader with a better understanding of how Chinese names compared to Western names. This proves very useful especially for those persons not familiar with the subtle differences.A highly recommended read.", "categories": ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction"],

{"asin": "B00005JDJT", "reviewText": "It may be coincidental that my favourite Jeff Buckley songs were written by others...'Lilac Wine' and 'Hallelujah'. But in the usual banter we have when comparing him to his father, it's Tim trumping the prodigal with his lyric skills, which is by no means an attempt to diminish Jeff's gifts. 'Grace' is unquestionably a more listenable, intimate and coherent album than any of his fathers'. And if you wanted added proof of his virtuosity then this concert, held in July 1995,is a fabulous testament. The warmth of his voice is astonishing. But my prompt to get the album is the incomparable, final track, with my idol, Alim Qasimov, not from the concert at L'Olympia. It's tacked on, fairly seamlessly, from a concert of Sacred Music, held two weeks later, in the small village of Saint Florent Le Vieil in Western France. The latter had heard Jeff and invited him to the event. When he heard Qasimov rehearsing he was so overawed by the master's supreme purity, Buckley endured a period of great doubt before agreeing to join Qasimov for this duet. What a find! Or a find that these two matchless souls could unify, if only briefly.'What Will You Say' is the evidence.

{"asin": "B000001FBZ", "reviewText": "Although he can be at least partly to blame for pop music becoming more drenched in electronic glop from the 1980s to the present day, Giorgio Moroder did a great deal to bring electronic music and synthesizers into the mainstream; and before such instruments became a cliche, they could be used for very haunting moments and used in very orchestral ways (as Walter Carlos had done for Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in 1971).  The best example for this in Moroder's case is the score he composed for director Alan Parker's ultra-disturbing, based-on-a-true-story 1978 film MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, about the horror that a young American named Billy Hayes faced while jailed in Turkey on a drug possession chage.Apart from the vocal tracks by David Castle (\"Istanbul Blues\") and Chris Bennett (the vocal version of the \"Midnight Express\" theme), it is entirely Moroder's show; and his inventive use of keyboards and synthesizers ingeniously straddles the line between pop, electronic, and orchestral music.  The epic eight and a half minute opener \"Chase\" became a minor pop hit in March 1979, and a permanent favorite with the disco and dance crowds from that point on.  Moroder's score got MIDNIGHT EXPRESS one of its two Oscars (the other going to Oliver Stone for his screenplay adaptation of Billy Hayes' book), incredibly beating out John Williams' score for SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, which was pretty hard to do given Williams' already imposing standing.  This is well worth picking up as a great example of electronic movie music that takes on a classic orchestral quality.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Dance & Electronic", "Disco"], "core_classes": [["root", "Dance & Electronic"], ["root", "Pop"], ["root", "Dance & Electronic", "Disco"], ["root", "Pop", "Dance Pop"], ["root", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["root", "Dance & Electronic", "Electronica"], ["root", "Dance & Electronic", "World Dance"]]}

Noor would drive there and pick up Truvy and her children and take them back to her house, but sometimes Truvy would change her mind and decide she couldn't leave.  Truvy and Noor worked together and Noor could tell that when Truvy wore turtlenecks she was trying to hide the bruises.After so many calls to Noor to rescue Truvy, Noor realized that she could not continue to do this.  She told Truvy that she would help her any way she could, but there would be no more coming in the middle of the night to rescue her and the boys.  Truvy seemed to understand and there was always the story that Jake was shaping up and was sorry and wouldn't hit her again. Noor knew differently.Things get worse before they get better for Truvy.  It's a story of how manipulative and abusive some alcoholics can be, and how enabling family members can be.  It also has something to say about the courts, but I'm not sure how realistic that is.

{"asin": "B0035LCZSG", "reviewText": "I am so impressed with this little camcorder, compared to anything else I've used in this price range, that I felt compelled to write a rather thorough review.What I was looking for in a camcorder:Size - I didn't need it to fit in my pants pocket, but I wanted it to easily fit in a coat pocket, which it does.Quality of parts - i.e. metal tripod threads, anti-reflective screen, real doors (as opposed to rubber plugs); this camera has metal tripod threads, semi glossy screen, and one real door and one rubber plug style door (for the power jack). It looks and feels like a quality piece.Optical image stabilization - digital stabilization shows it's weakness when zooming in, this camera uses OIS and it works very well.Low light performance - Since I film as much indoors as out it must be able to shoot good video indoors, this camera is pretty good (especially with \"Color Night Record\" on.Light/flash - to assist in indoor shooting, this light is good only up fairly close for video and snapshots.Wide angle lens (or lens barrel threads) - since it will be used indoors a lot. The lens on this camcorder is very good at wide angle with no noticable barrel distortion. No barrel threads though.Strong optical zoom - digital zoom degrades quality, so I want at least 15x optical zoom, this camera excels in this area.CEC compliant (or a remote control) - So I don't need a long HDMI cable to control playback of the camera while watching it on a TV, works great with my Samsung TV and remote. You cannot use a remote control for shooting video though.Real dedicated buttons (not all touch screen) - I find that when everything is controlled through a touchscreen, even the simplest adjustments can be tedious and frustrating, and usually takes much more time than just pushing a dedicated button. I am very happy Panasonic has all of the additional hard buttons.Good battery life - about 1.5 hoursThings I wish this camcorder had:Time lapse and motion activationRemote control - I miss the functionality a remote gave me on my JVCLens barrel threads - for UV filters (and other filters)My other camcorder considerations in this price range:I purchased and returned aCanon VIXIA HF R11 Full HD Camcorder w/32GB Flash MemoryYou can read my review of it in the 2-star section of its page.I looked at the Sony Handycam HDR-CX110 but could not steady the camera at full zoom. It does not have optical image stabilization. The next Sony that has OIS (HDR-CX300) costs a lot more and was out of my budget. The Sony was too small which made operating the controls awkward and uncomfortable while holding it. Good for putting in a pocket though. I didn't like the manual lens cover; it seemed cheap.I was seriously considering one of the JVC Everios with Super Low Lux for low light recording, but my last two camcorders were gently used JVCs and both died for no reason.My review is mostly bullet points. But I do want to say though that I am very happy with this camcorder purchase. The two biggest gripes I have so far is the auto white balance that other reviewers mention, and video shot on a sunny day almost looks like it was shot during a cloudy day when played back. It's an easy fix when editing though.  I'll play with the manual settings a little more to see if I can improve it. And adjusting the white balance is very easy. Also, some have given this camcorder a one-star review because it's not compatible with their Mac. It all depends how old your Mac is and what software you are running on it. I know that with iMovie 09 you can open and edit the .MTS files directly from the camcorder. Just don't use the included Panasonic software. Same thing with a PC, if your computer is too old it just won't be able to process the HD video.I gave it five stars based on how it compares with other camcorders in this price range. If I thought there was a better one out there for my needs I would have deducted stars.PROS:* Full printed manual* Amazing macro* Amazing zoom* Great optical image stabilization* Good low light performance* iA modes change fairly quickly* Wide angle lens* Auto on/off* Zoom microphone* Very comfortable to hold* Made in Japan* Built in automatic lens cap* Good battery lifeCONS:* Some cheap feeling plastic (palm rest could have soft-touch coating)* Power jack location - makes using some camera controls awkward when the power cord is plugged in* Touch screen is still too glossy* No lens filter threads* Warranty - only 90 days labor* Cost of accessories through Panasonic (see below)Battery (extended) - $129.95Battery charger - $59.9532GB SDHC card (class 10) - $349.95HDMI cable (3 meter) - $69.99Well, as I am writing this review I see Amazon has listed a new Panasonic camcorder as a newer version to this one. The HDC-SD80 is available for pre-sale. I'm glad I purchased this one because the new one is almost ALL touch-screen now. I wouldn't even consider it. They did address the power jack location, but it looks like they are going to a cheaper manual lens cover like on the Sony.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Video"], "core_classes":

{"asin": "B002GYTPAE", "reviewText": "Seems to be very nice quality. Only reason I rate it what I do is the loudness of the sound. The records we have played thus far are having to be played at max volume on my receiver. This is on a Panasonic surround sound system that has 600 watts. Not sure why it's not louder.The automatic start and stop is nice. And looks like it will last a long time. Just wish the volume it would produce was better.I do plan on picking up a preamp. I am pretty sure that is the issue. I don't know why others say it's not needed. All the issues seem to stem from the lack there of.I will update the review once the preamp is added. Though at that point the review won't only be about the unit.Updated:I found the line in switch, and it is a very small blackl switch on the back of the unit.  Very easily missed, if you don't know you should be looking for it.Now that it is switched to line, it is working like I had hoped it would.  Very pleased with the quality for the price.  I am sure the 250-300 dollar ones will have a slightly better sound, but this is just what I was looking for.I would buy it again.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components"],

{"asin": "B000000IRG", "reviewText": "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road has to be the most quintessential Elton John album. It's the one mentioned and talked about the most. It should be. It is the best double album. Although, in today's world, this 17 song collection probably wouldn't be considered a double album. It starts off with one of the greatest album openers ever, &quot;Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;. A classic all the way. This album has a number of Elton's most recognized hits - &quot;Bennie And The Jets&quot;, The great &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting&quot;, and the original, and still best, version of &quot;Candle In The Wind&quot;. There are more great tracks here that are just as good. You get &quot;Sweet Painted Lady&quot;, which is about prostitutes. Then you have the storysong &quot;The Ballad Of Danny Bailey&quot;, which you wish Elton would play in concert. You get a number of great rockers like &quot;Dirty Little Girl&quot;, &quot;All The Young Girls Love Alice&quot;, and &quot;Your Sister Can't Twist(But She Can Rock And Roll)&quot;, among others. But, the crowning jewel, is the highly underrated and horribly overlooked gem, &quot;Harmony&quot;. It's the closing track and, without a doubt, the greatest Elton John song that was never a single. That's a crime if ever there was one. It's a great piece of music. The album also includes the rousing up tempo number &quot;Grey Seal&quot;. The silliest track is a song called &quot;Jamaica Jerk Off&quot;. It's fun and catchy, but silly. There you have it. The perfect Elton John album. The perfect rock album. This is Elton's Sgt. Pepper.

Harper Fox's vivid description of her majestic mountains, the setting of her story, could not be more alluring. As a reader I could only marvel at her use of words and flow of sentences. My problem is this is a novella and Harper Fox's beautiful descriptive style, be it in the setting, her guys' characters development or emotional struggles, really suit a longer novel better. I come away from this one, feeling a bit dissatisfied, reason for 4 and not 5 stars.So the romance between the guys skipped the first meeting and development part as they have known each other for 5 years. It basically started with Kestrel breaking down with the realization that his ex-lover was fading from his memory and the reason was Rory, his partner in work for 5 years. At the same time it was no secret that Rory has long held a crush for Kestrel. Here is the angst, which is the core of the the story, where Kestrel has to finally let go of his past and move on and Harper Fox could not have done it better. But in the process Rory's character is sort of lost because the focus is on Kestrel and this being a novella, does not leave much room for Rory's feelings. And because this is a novella, the final declaration of love at the end seems rushed. One reviewer does not like the subplot with its little twist but I find it a refreshing angle of the story.Still an enjoyable read and Harper Fox's distinctive and beautiful style just place her a notch above even the best in this genre, in terms of soulful writing.", "categories": ["Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Books", "Romance"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges"], ["root", "Appliances", "Parts & Accessories"], ["root", "Books", "Romance", "Gay Romance"], ["root", "Books", "Romance", "Lesbian Romance"], ["root", "Books", "Romance", "Romantic Suspense"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Contemporary"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Nonfiction"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Biographies & Memoirs"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges", "Freestanding Ranges"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges", "Drop-In Ranges"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges", "Slide-In Ranges"], ["root", "Appliances", "Parts & Accessories", "Fasteners"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Biographical"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Metaphysical"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Westerns"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Satire"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Fiction"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Literary Criticism"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama", "Eastern"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama", "Children's"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama", "Tragedy"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama", "Comedy"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama", "Classical & Early"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Erotica"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Poetry"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Biographies & Memoirs", "Lesbian"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Nonfiction", "Bisexuality"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Nonfiction", "Transgender"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Nonfiction", "Philosophy"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Nonfiction", "Coming Out"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Nonfiction", "Activism"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Biographies & Memoirs", "Transgender"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Fiction", "Romance"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Fiction", "Lesbian"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Fiction", "Gay"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama", "Gay"], ["root", "Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature & Fiction", "Poetry", "Gay"]]}

These books, however, prove that it is what is on the inside that counts. Looking at the outside, I assumed this was some cheesy story that might be fun for the kids to read, but that's about it. I borrowed it on my amazon prime membership because I had read a couple of stories from this author with my daughter that were pretty intriguing. I searched the author's name and found these books. I spent about 3 weeks trying to decide if I wanted to waste my free month rental on this. I finally decided that it was worth a look.

I am now anxiously waiting the release of book 3 and will buy it when it comes out as well.

{"asin": "B003O55U8K", "reviewText": "The converter I got as of the time of this review was unbranded in a plain brown box, and a different model than pictured. It is about the same size, but is in a white and black plastic case that might break if accidentally stepped on, and not a black metal case. The audio output is a 3.5 mm stereo jack instead of the separate left and right RCA jacks. The unit did come with the necessary 5V DC universal (110v/220vac) adapter, and a small instruction booklet. I tested it with a Raspberry Pi (which I needed it for in the first place) and a Sony Blu-Ray player as sources, and with two different VGA monitors.The device seems to do its job very well, and translates the capabilities of the analog VGA output device to the HDMI capabilities advertised to the HDMI source. For example when connecting its VGA output to an old 1280x1024 4:3 monitor the device told the HDMI source to send 720p content. When the VGA output was hooked up to a 1920x1080 16:9 device, it requested 1080p. It appears to do this dynamically without having to turn off the power. When playing 16:9 content on an old 4:3 monitor the image is compressed horizontally to fit the narrow screen. The device must be HDCP capable because I've played commercial Blu-Ray disks through it with no problems.The picture quality of the analog VGA out is as expected: not quite as sharp and vibrant as a direct digital HDMI connection, but it is acceptable. The stereo sound is fine. When the supplied DC adapter is disconnected, the sound continues to work, but the output video signal disappears. I wouldn't count on it working from the power provided by an HDMI source.It does exactly what I expected it to do very well, so I'm giving it 5 stars.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video"], ["root", "Pop", "Adult Alternative"], ["root", "Pop", "Oldies"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Television Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Compact Stereos"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Multiroom Digital Music Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "TV-DVD Combinations"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Blu-ray Players & Recorders"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Tape Decks"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Turntables"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Blu-ray Players & Recorders", "Blu-ray Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "CD Players & Recorders"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Tuners"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Blu-ray Players & Recorders", "Blu-ray Recorders"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "LED TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Radios", "Shower Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Radios", "Personal Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "LCD TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "OLED TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "Plasma TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Radios", "Clock Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Radios", "Shortwave Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Radios", "Weather Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Stands"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Cases"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Speaker Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Subwoofers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Center-Channel Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Floorstanding Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Soundbar Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Speaker Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Satellite Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Docking Stations"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Remote Controls"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "CD Players & Recorders", "CD Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "CD Players & Recorders", "CD Recorders"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Mounting Kits"]]}

{"asin": "B008S0BLCA", "reviewText": "Metz debut is a blistering and punishing 29 minutes of what would be the equivalent of aural shock therapy. Equal parts crushing drums, screeching guitar noise and vocal shredding this is the kind of album that needs to come along every so often to wake us from our everyday coma and remind us that rock `n roll does still exist. And it can still be dangerous.The Toronto power trio wastes no time in pummeling the listener. Opener `Headache' opens with big drums and massive guitars that are reminiscent of Nirvana's `Serve The Servants' off In Utero. There are many similarities between that Nirvana swan song and this debut. The loud, abrasive guitar spurts and big, overblown drums and of course the primal scream vocals all bring that Seattle three piece that changed everything in 1992 to mind. But besides the `sound' they bring to mind, Metz also has Nirvana's ability to assault you while at the same time writing something you'll remember. Underneath all the violence and anger there's an underlying song craft. But for the most part, Metz just beats the snot out of you. `Sad Pricks' is pure violence and chaos put to tape. `Rats' is the musical equivalent of the bombing of Dresden during WWll. `Knife in the Water' could almost be called catchy. Then the screams begin. `Nausea' actually lives up to it's title. A minute long piece of music that sounds as if the tape machine was about to break. Wobbling all the way through to the end. `Wet Blanket' is a scrapper. Throwing punches all the way to the end. The spirit of Detroit lives in this excellent track. MC5 and The Stooges are alive and well in this bloody nose of a song.Besides Nirvana these Toronto punks, either intentionally or unintentionally, bring to mind Big Black, old school Dinosaur Jr, The Pixies and Wire on PCP. There's also a similarity to Cloud Nothing. Metz is Cloud Nothing's big brother that just got released from prison.Metz is a force to be reckoned with. They play rock `n roll that's angry, brutal, violent and dangerous. It's also meticulous, precise, catchy and razor wire sharp.

{"asin": "B007ZBWJX8", "reviewText": "This album marks the 30th year of this super group since their 1982 debut. After their reformation with the original lineup, they released two albums, Phoenix in 2008 and Omega in 2010. Now, they're here with their third album, the aptly titled XXX.The songs are built on a strong foundation of melodic sensibility, perfected by Downes' keyboard and Howe's guitar work. The duo craft trademark Asia hooks and inject them into the compostions seamlessly. The lush, open sound production certainly enhances their delivery, leaving enough breathing room for John Wetton's vocals. Often times, his voice is treated with an overlay of reverb to give the songs deep space and resonance. The 'midnight mix' of the ballad \"I Know How You Feel\" cuts out most of the other instrumentation of the original version and puts the entire emphasis on Wetton's vocals, morphing it into a totally new song in a sense. Wetton's harmonies are sublime, too. \"Bury Me in a Willow\" is classic Asia, with its gripping 80s pop feel while the backing tracks of \"No Religion\" continue to loom over the arrangement as the rest of the band builds webs of melodies over sparse chord progressions. Steve Howe's guitar tone is to die for: clean and articulate. He adopts a wide range of techniques, from briefly blues-inflicted touches to funk-infested grooves and crystal-clear acoustic passages. Songs like \"Reno\" and \"Ghost of a Chance\" both feature acoustic solos which feel like songs within songs themselves. Carl Palmer proves he is one of the most unique drummers in all of rock. What some may consider questionable and uneventful is actually where this man's strengths lie. His deceptively simple yet powerfully accented beat constructs suggest he understands the need of the songs the best, impelling each piece forward with deftly nuanced cymbal and percussion work. Keyboards are as integral to this album as any previous disc. With richly textured symphonic pop hooks and melting piano lines, Downes is the key figure punctuating the melodies and bringing the tracks to their conclusion. Thanks to Mike Paxman's production work, there is even a blazing organ solo on the album that strangely connects the band to Uriah Heep.Fans of Asia must hear this album, even if they gave up on them back in 1992. This could be the album to reassure them that the band they once loved is still solid as a rock.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Rock", "Progressive"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root",

{"asin": "B002PHLZE6", "reviewText": "BRIEF ASSESSMENTVerbatim's CLON aims to be yet another home computer or laptop backup solution in an field already crowded by both near-similar products and competing technologies.As far as I can tell, there is nothing that would distinguish the CLON or make it stand out as a leading product in its class.FEATURESSize----The CLON is built around the ubiquitous 2.5\" SATA HDD form factor. It's a highly standardized format because all SATA drives are meant to fit inside standard laptop drive bays and it's impossible to make it any smaller. To state that the CLON is one of the smallest 2.5\" drives is not very meaningful. 2.5\" is... 2.5\", always. After placing the CLON next to theStarTech SAT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosure, it turns out that the CLON has the exact same width and thickness but, indeed, it is 1/8\" shorter than the InfoSafe and the InfoSafe does not claim to be 'one of the smallest'.Portability-----------All 2.5\" external SATA drives are nearly equally portable. It would have been nice if the CLON came with some (cushioned) carrying box that would also hold the USB wire but it doesn't. The CLON is only a bare-bones drive in a black enclosure.Design------The drive's enclosure closely follows the disk's flat shape, nothing notable unless the fact that it is 'black' can get someone excited. The plastic is mostly matte, not shiny so, unless you touch the part of the enclosure that is shiny, fingerprints won't be visible.A design or maybe an engineering issue is the plastic body. The CLON tends to run pretty hot because plastic is not so good at dissipating heat. Disks encased in an aluminum casing can stay much cooler but they are a little heavier too. If all you need the CLON is for the occasional 'peace of mind' backup, this shouldn't be a big deal. My unit, while getting alarmingly hot, did not melt during my test 4.5 hours backup job.Storage-------320GB is a good chunk of space for backups but 'state of the art' for a 2.5\"/9.5mm SATA at the time I write this review is 640GB. 1TB 2.5\" SATA drives are available in the more exotic 12.5mm form factor.Versatility-----------Like all external HDDs in its class, the CLON is powered by the host laptop/desktop via the USB wire. Unlike some, powering it through a separate power adaptor is not an option.The CLON comes formatted as NTFS. This is the native file system for Windows XP and Vista but, as far as I know, Macs are not very comfortable with it. Mac compatibility is claimed and I have no reason to doubt that this is indeed the case.Backup capabilities-------------------I was not impressed by the bundled Nero BackItUp 4. It took it over 4 hours to back up 80GB and, to make it worse, it doesn't have a way of backing up a Windows system partition (the C: drive in most cases). I posted to screenshots providing some supporting evidence to the statements I made above. I uninstalled Nero because I have no use for it.Performance-----------Almost 4.5 hours to backup 80GB (with verify) is just terrible. I am blaming the backup software for this sluggishness but I found no compelling evidence that would place the CLON drive among the top performers in its class.Value-----A 320GB OEM drive, a 2.5\" SATA enclosure and a 1-foot long USB wire can be had for less than the CLON sells and the end-result would be something almost indistinguishable from Verbatim's product - I put together 2 of these myself out of older discarded laptop and PS3 drives. CLON's price is not at all attractive. A drive enclosure can be had for less than $5 and it usually comes with the needed USB cable. An equivalent, good quality 2.5\", 360GB, 5400RPM SATA drive can be had for about $60 at the time I write this. You add up the 2 and, it turns out that there isn't a lot of value in the CLON. Even for those who don't feel comfortable with assembling a CLON-like portable drive from scratch, competitors offer drives of similar physical size with larger storage (500GB) and some backup utility at a lower price.Note:Since I wrote this review, the price of this unit dropped by 30%. This is a very sensible thing to do because only a completely uninformed customer would have bought it at the 'list' price, only to regret it. This brings the 'value' closer if not on par with what other vendors charge for equivalent products but I still maintain the the CLON is a 'nondescript' product that offers nothing above and beyond the competition does.EVALUATIONI found nothing that would compel me to 'like' the CLON and pick IT over whatever the competition offers and therefore grant it 4 stars. At the same time, the slow backup software aside, there is little really 'bad' about it. CLON is a mediocre product that barely earns its 3-stars which the Amazon star translators decode as \"it's OK\".Since the backup software was CLON's worst feature, I uninstalled it as soon as my little benchmark backup completed. And, since I just happen to have a 320GB HDD on my PS3, I formatted the CLON for FAT32 (used FAT32FORMAT) and I am using it now to back up my PS3 - backing up the about 120GB of PS3 content completed in less than one third of the time it took NERO's BackItUp to finish my laptop's 80GB C: partition.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage"], "core_classes":

{"asin": "B001DVZXC0", "reviewText": "I use this box to convert roof-top antenna digital format signals to analog,  so my older Toshiba Analog-Tuner DVR can record over-the-air (OTA) programming.  This allows me to record at the same time my DirecTV DVR is recording satellite signals.  I use the programmable features of both DVRs to get the programs I want.I bought the Zinwell ZAT-970A model because it advertised a programmable channel feature, allowing me to program whichever channel I desired at whatever time I wanted.  The unit that was delivered does not have a programmable channel feature, at least that I've been able to find, and I'm an engineer.  I have to change channels manually.  Fortunately, most of the OTA programs I care to record are on the local MeTV channel (which isn't available on DirecTV, not even on their OTA channels), so I don't need to change the channel - I just leave the unit powered on all the time on the MeTV channel.  If the unit had the programmable features that were advertised, I'd program it to turn on and off, and to change to some other OTA channels I'd like to see.I have sent several messages to the manufacturer but have not received even an acknowledgement of receipt of my messages.Otherwise, the unit works well, and picture quality is very good, even on my 42 inch LCD flat screen.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Analog-to-Digital (DTV) Converters"], "core_classes": [["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Pop"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["root", "Pop", "Adult Alternative"], ["root", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

{"asin": "B009UX4EVY", "reviewText": "Two of thrash metal/crossover's fiercest and most old-school-sounding new bands, Phil Anselmo & The Illegals and Warbeast, pinned their heads together to kick out a split release in January of 2013. \"War Of The Gargantuas,\" a four song short-player, might clock in at a combined total of only eighteen minutes in length, but it sure packs a lot of punch into its brief playing time. The split, uh, splits its time between two separate yet equally as potent styles: Vicious, cut-throat brutality and steady, slow-burning grind.On the whole, \"War\" is the sound of a couple of throwback thrash outfits that have a definite thing for hard and grindcore without ever descending into crappy, trendy metalcore territory. Leading by example, \"Conflict,\" with its spilling-guts-on-the-mic vocals, surging groove, chainsaw riffing, pounding, blasting drums, and memorable, wah/whammy-soaked leads, could very well be passed off as a Superjoint Ritual b-side. But no matter what band made it, it is one awesome, a**-kicking opener, lemme tell ya! \"Birth Of A Psycho\" is equally as brutal, as it is brimming with ferocious riffing and grinding blasts; but then the album takes on a slightly more mid-tempo approach with \"Family, `Friends,' And Associates,\" which opts for a steady beating. It is highlighted, however, by a screaming, and shred-happy guitar solo, too, though. And then following that comes still more memorable riffing and excellent soloing pretty much all throughout the closing \"IT.\"At the end of the day, \"War Of The Gargantuas\" is not an absolutely, bloody essential purchase. But it is nothing if not a very tasty little sampler that should whet the appetites of listeners everywhere enough to check out the bands further. And this alone makes \"War\" a worthy listen, because trust me, folks, you are definitely gonna want to buy the full-lengths.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal", "Pop Metal"], "core_classes": [["root", "Hard Rock & Metal"], ["root", "Hard Rock & Metal", "Alternative Metal"], ["root", "Hard Rock & Metal", "Thrash & Speed Metal"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Hardcore & Punk"]]}

It's a crossover as Joe Morello, enters the fold and makes all the difference in the drum seat compared to Brubeck's former drummer Joe Dodge. Eugene Wright, the soon to be bass player was not on board, but once he was, we have the classic Brubeck Quartet and I do mean Classic. A very good listening experience; sorry, at my age it took so long to hear this.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz", "Cool Jazz"], "core_classes": [["root", "Davis"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

{"asin": "B0000AZW9O", "reviewText": "I am privileged to own volumes 4, 7, and 8 in the series.  They are my favorite albums by Mehdi.  Like the other titles in the series, this is not very complex material, but the message conveyed is worthwhile and pleasing to the ear.  You can think of it as sonic poetry.  Some songs on this album have a sad feel to them, but it is all part of the journey.  If you already know you like this type of music, almost any Mehdi title will do, but I think 4, 7, and 8 are his best work.  Mehdi aimed at Instrumental Heaven with this one.  I believe he hit the mark.  Also, I can recommend some other fabulous artists in the New Age genre.  You may want to explore 2002, Mythos, Amethystium, and Blue Stone.

They've made up their own rules, because they didn't particularly like the original ones completely. (And the 2 year old's permanent position is the breaker of the buildings.) They look at the cards and build what they see.The block quality surprised me. They are wooden blocks, not plastic. (Big bonus!) They are also more stained than painted. (You can see the wood grain through the color.) I think the higher quality attributes a lot to how much they enjoy playing.

{"asin": "B000025SME", "reviewText": "This is the original Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac at their gritty best. I actually bought this as part of a 2 record set called Black Magic Woman on Epic records paired with the eponymous Trash Can release (also worth owning) back in '74 and has been played consistently ever since (I jammed with it just yesterday). For me there isn't a bad track to be had and is I think essential listening for anyone who digs Les Pauls, from the biting intro to Stop Messin' Round to the beautiful Albatross.This album also shows how talented Danny Kirwan was with his tracks Something Inside Of Me (awesome minor key blues plus nice rhythm guitar work from Peter) and One Sunny Day (pretty mean sounding with great rhythm section work from Fleetwood and McVie, simple but effective). Jigsaw Puzzle Blues is another fine offering by Danny showing a bit of a Django Reinhardt influence, as was the case for many of the British players of the '60s.I like Jeremy Spencer's work as well especially Doctor Brown with strong vocals and slide work.But the best of all is the original version of Black Magic Woman, one of the all time greats (I also have the British single version where reverb is added to Peter's tone for the second cycle of his solo).When I was in a cover band a couple of years  ago we did Santana's version, mainly as a showcase for our drummer, but I would have been happy to play it Peters way. Love That Burns is another fave, displaying not only Peter's less is more fills, lead work and picking hand dynamics but his awesome vocals.Its funny, my wife has a bunch of the Buckingham/Nicks Mac recordings but I can hardly  think of them as the same group as the Peter Green era. English Rose is a perfect example of why.

{"asin": "B00EVZ5M4O", "reviewText": "women think they understand how guys need to be or behave, but the truth is, never take dating advice from women, only from men. Women's logic is like a mad hamster who spins in it's wheel: you can watch it all you want, it won't make sense. Not only that, they will lead you on the wrong path, trash advice such as 'be confident', 'be her friend' (most men know that women DO NOT have sex with their friends). In fact, my rule is to NEVER be friend to a woman I'd like to have sex with. First off, being her friend is humiliating. While you are there supporting her silly crap and listening to how some jerk she's been sleeping with, treated her badly, you are there like a schmuck wasting your time, knowing she will get back to him for more while you go back home jerking off.The only women who can be 'friends' are the ones who I would NOT have sex with.Don't be their schmuck who gives her 'support' , you will be her therapist but never her lover,  pass this trash book up and check out Bang by Roosh. PS. A man's friends are MALE, not female. A man doesn't do 'favours' to a woman he'd like to sleep with. I know it's crazy and weird but it's the truth.

{"asin": "B000065SXM", "reviewText": "The debut album from Doves 'Lost Souls' showed that this Mancunian group had plenty of potential. It was one of the highlights of that year. While the second one may have taken two years to come about, the wait has proved to be worth it. Doves with this new album have produced the first true heavyweight release for Indie rock this year. It's the first Indie rock album that you know will become successful in the mainstream circles this year. In fact some people have gone so far as to categorise it alongside 'The Bends' or even 'Urban Hymns'. The funny thing is, is that it doesn't really have many similarities with the debut album. In fact it bears a closer resemblance to this groups '93 incarnation when they were known as Sub Sub. There are plenty of hints at the dark moody and at times deeply melancholic sounds of 'Lost Souls' but this album is generally a much more upbeat affair. It's also remarkable that they happen to be touring with Travis right now because the similarities between the two groups is quite remarkable. Musically they share a fairly similar(...ish) sound and you can hear plenty of bygone era influences. But even more similar is the fact that both groups released debut c.d.'s which had moderate success and then it all exploded on the release of the 2nd album. Doves with very little hype, airplay, etc managed to stay on top of the U.K. album charts for 2 weeks. A remarkable feat when you consider some of the over-hyped dirge that generally tops that chart.The music on this c.d. has a far more populist sound. I mean the anthems such as &quot;Pounding&quot;-a remarkably apt title and sulphur which even has a fanfare intro are destined to have major broad appeal. They are the sort of tracks that have that killer appeal and stay in your head for days on end. Plenty of tracks seem to have a certain flavour of 60's psychedelia meets Northern Soul-track 2 &quot;Words&quot; is a dead ringer for this. Just one listen to the guiatrs and drums and you'll know exactly what I mean. The huge single &quot;There Goes The Fear&quot; is simply incredible-I mean when did a near 7 minute track reach #3 in the charts? I mean this song has so many glorious moments that as soon as I heard it I was putting it on repeat play for nearly an hour. The last song I heard that had such  instant appeal was Colplay's 'Yellow'. My own personal section is the last minute when the latino rhumba kicks in to close the track out. The 60's flavour continues with &quot;M62 Song&quot; which is actually a rewritten King Crimson track. The 6th track &quot;N.Y.&quot; comes across initially sounding like a heavy piece of early Brit-rock circa the Oasis debut. This is before the interaction of soft verse meets very heavy chorus. I'm not over keen on the gospel blues of &quot;Satellites&quot; which I think drags on a bit too long. Apart from this track I can't think of one other bad one though. Some of the fans of the debut maybe a bit displeased but there is still plenty of Doves own brand of broody tracks as the album goes on-&quot;Friday's Dust&quot;-it's a dark and complex track of rare beauty and it's not often you'll hear arrangements of strings ,etc done in such an unusual way. Whatever happens this album should now see Doves slip comfortably into the big league on the basis of this very fine album.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "British Alternative"],

{"asin": "B000002JKS", "reviewText": "Shaken 'n' Stirred (Robert Plant's third solo release) is an entertaining and somewhat unconventional piece of music.  There's a total of nine songs.  I find every one of them to be worthy and pleasing.  Some of the material is in a straightforward pop rock musical direction, while other tracks are in an experimental pop rock vein.  Six of them also contain female backing vocals.  The songwriting is good and creative, the musicianship is proficient, and the production is tight.  The keyboards (played by Jezz Woodroffe) are a prominent facet throughout the album.  Robbie Blunt's guitar work mostly takes more of a secondary role--except for &quot;Kallalou Kallalou&quot; and &quot;Pink and Black.&quot;  When it comes to the vocals, Plant does a nice job.  Ritchie Hayward's drumming is skillful and taut, too.  The tune that I enjoy the most is the straight-ahead, atmospheric &quot;Little by Little.&quot;  The smooth &quot;Sixes and Sevens&quot; is also a gratifying ballad that's just over six minutes in duration.  The song from Shaken 'n' Stirred that I find to be the most offbeat and adventurous is the quirky &quot;Too Loud.&quot;  The aspects of this sprightly tune that attract me especially are the weird-sounding keyboard work, the lighthearted, interesting vocals from Plant, and the female background vocals.  Another one that's progressive in style that I like is &quot;Trouble Your Money&quot;--it resembles something that the Police would write.  I enjoy how this ambient track rises and falls in intensity.  &quot;Doo Doo a Do Do&quot; is also a song that's different and pleasing; it features cool keyboard playing and energetic female backing vocals.  The CD insert doesn't include the song lyrics.  The disc is just over 42 minutes long.

{"asin": "B0090TZCF0", "reviewText": "Practical Wilderness Skills and Thoughts on Survival by White Wolf Von Atzingen is a compilation of articles that were put together to form a book. I actually liked this short book but can see how many would not as it is very esoteric. Being that this book is a compilation of articles there is no flow, per se, from one article to the next. On top of that the author comes across as a little \"different.\" The reason I liked this book is because there is a heavy focus on mindset over skillset. Yes, one needs both to survive but many books skim over the mindset with little more than mentioning it as being crucial. As a former officer survival instructor for a law enforcement agency I created and taught a class on mindset so this is a topic that I understand. It seems that the author intended for the reader to read between the lines to get some of his messages which can be easily missed. The author wants you to work for the meaning and he doesn't specifically spell out the message.When discussing mindset it is easy to get into the \"hokey\" realm which can turn readers off. In some respects this is a book where \"less is more.\" There is a lot of focus on being in tune with and aware of your environment. While some skills are discussed this really isn't a book about skills. As former Navy SEAL CJ Caracci says, \"The mind controls the body; the body does not control the mind.\" Those who have never faced adversity may not grasp the true meaning of this statement or this book. This book is not for everyone and many will miss the point.I have never heard of White Wolf Von Atzingen before reading this book so I did an Internet search.

{"asin": "B007R8U5R6", "reviewText": "I have the AVR590 and bought this (due to price cut to $400) for my dad after already getting him the Onkyo TX-NR515.  He has a 4.1 with polk psw505 subwoofer, monitor 75t floors, and pioneer bs22 bookshelves as surrounds, no center (yet).some tips and thoughts (i'm VERY NEW to hifi and not an audiophile yet, below is just what a lot of people seem to write on forums):-- do a firmware update via internet ethernet cable as soon as you get it (although without it, original firmware probably is not as crippling as Onkyo's)-- the first spot used to mic the Audyssey calibration is also the one that sticks the most (most of the resulting distances and levels correspond to it).  the rest of the locations don't seem to nearly matter as much as the first one.  make sure you are quiet during.-- if you have floorstanding front speakers that hasn't got a lot of bass to them, ie, no 10 or 12\" woofers and didn't cost $500 ON SALE per speaker, and you DO have a subwoofer: after Audyssey calibration, manually set the fronts from \"Large\" to \"Small\" under Speaker Config, and change the individual crossovers to somewhere between 80Hz to 120Hz, and the subwoofer crossover to be the same.  that was the only adjustment I had to after the calibration.once correctly calibrated for subwoofer, Audyssey MultEQ does things a lot better than Audyssey 2EQ: i used the same set of speakers and recorded pink floyd's great gig in the sky using Sony PCM-M10 several times on each AVR, and compared the resulting waveform on the computer.  MultEQ's waveform had very distinct clear high and lows, whereas the waveform for Onkyo appeared muddy, with unjustified highs and dents in the waveform.  in one Onkyo sample, there were some weird sound introduced into the sound that shouldn't have been there.  my dad use the receiver mainly to listen to music, and this was the deciding factor.  we packed the Onkyo back up.  ps, besides just looking at the waveforms, Denon also *sounded* more detailed (to me, my dad couldn't tell any difference.)cons vs Onkyo 515:- no universal remote, Onkyo's universal remote was better. (not a big factor.  Onkyo's universal remote missed a few buttons that made switching inputs on the TV pretty annoying)- no 4k/2k upscaling, upscaling only for HDMI inputs. (not a big factor, my dad's current 1080p tv will last a while)- less HDMI/other ports (not a big factor, 6 is plenty)- more expensive ($100 diff at the time of writing, 3/3/2013)- i can't find DSP simulation modes like Rock Arena, Multi Stereo Channel, Orchastra, Matrix (what is it anyways), etc.  in the Denon menu, but apparently my Dad was able to find it on Onkyo.  (not a big deal if you have the Denon Phone App, which DOES have these simulations and works very well.  EDIT: they are accessed by holding down the Movie/Music/Game/Direct buttons on the remote)- no HDMI preview before switching (ah, now THAT was a nice feature on Onkyo that I already miss)pros vs Onkyo 515:- airplay (not a big factor.  i have no apple devices, but there are programs like AirFoil that make your PC/Mac an airplay source, but I couldn't get video to play on the Denon)- i thought the setup experience was much smoother with Denon.  for every device connected, Denon explicitly ask you how each device's audio/video is linked to the AVR, whereas with Onkyo you can have multiple inputs to the same \"source name\", which I never understood how the AVR would figure out which to play if both hdmi and component video of \"DVD\" are connected to different devices.- overall sound is better.  my dad actually prefered the wild un-EQ'ed bass on the Onkyo until he saw the waveforms on the computer.  There's no question Denon corrects speakers and has more accurate sound with MultEQ.i guess i had high hopes for Audyssey MultEQ with a 4.1, when my Denon AVR590's MultEQ did my 2.1 bookshelves so well.  so the initial AVR 1913 results' lack of bass were rather underwhelming.  but this is a machine that will do what you need it to do, and do it well, and probably for a long time -- my AVR590 has been a workhorse for years and still going strong.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root",

{"asin": "B000005GYR", "reviewText": "Kurt Elling is the new Golden Boy of Jazz Singing. I wrote a review of this side about four or five years ago on amazon.com, and while allot of what I said in favor of Kurt Elling's music still holds true, I have much to correct due to newness to the jazz scene when I first reviewed the record. First things first. For those who have said that Elling has not measured up to Mark Murphy should check out ... where Murphy is quoted paying Elling one of the highest compliments one singer could give to another. It should be evident by, if nothing else, his repertoire. On this side alone he shows us his wide listening vocabulary and great sense of tradition as far as jazz in concerned. He sites Murphy as well as the great Jon Hendricks. Also I think it is unfair to compare Elling to Murphy, Hendricks, or anyone else for that matter. Elling is his own man. He has made his own way in jazz singing. However, he has also learned from those that have come before him. An admirable quality in an artist. This is the breakdown of his first side which was original intended to only be a demo of the music he had been making during that time.1. Close Your Eyes. Title cut. Honestly there's not much else to say about this particular cut. It's swingin' Bop chart from the pages of Ella Fitzgerald's songbook, and it is a great choice in little known standards in which we are first introduced to the music of Kurt Elling.2. Delores Dream. I at one time sited this as some kind of broadway chart because of something I had misread. Kurt Elling's lyric to Wayne Shorter's musical master piece Delores. This the first Vocalese lyric of Elling's we are to hear. He takes Wayne's solo and uses it as an unaccompanied introduction to the groovy melody that I just can't enough of. Many have said, and Elling was one of the first to admit this, that his scatting abilities had a long ways to go at this point, however, it is still quite enjoyable to listen to. (Check out the extended cut of this on the Live in Chicago: Out Takes cut).3. Ballad of the Sad Young Men. It took me over two years and three recordings before I has able to snag a chart for this cut. It's written by the same songwriting duo that gave us Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most. Elling and his pianist Laurence Hobgood to a remarkable duet of this bittersweet song of squandered youth and regret.4. Salom&eacute;, (Hide the). Yeah, I don't get the title either. Well, I do have an idea, but that's beside the point. This Hard Bop/Fusion composition of Hobgood's that amazingly enough is set to a swing. Elling pens a very groovy and imaginative lyric about obsession and desperation.5. Married Blues. A hilarious prose set to spontaneous accompaniment. In short, what's going on in a sarcastic husband's head during some frustrated times. You simply have to hear it to understand.6. Storyteller Experiencing Total Confusion. Elling/Hobgood piece with a poem inserted in the middle, and I think there's a quote from the Miles DAvis cut Blue In Green from Kind of Blue. It's profound and surreal. That's all there is to say without hearing it.7. Never Say Goodbye. One of the first collaborations between Elling and Hobgood this Bossa Nova/Fusion cut about past love and that ever burning desire to one to whom you will never have to say, \"Goodbye\".8. Those Clouds Are Heavy, You Dig? Now the say in the liner notes that this Dave Brubeck/Paul Desmond composition was originally titled Balcony Rock, but it was really Audrey, a song written for the the great Audrey Hepburn. Desmond was reportedly infatuated with her at the time. Kurt's Vocalese is an adaptation of the poem, \"How the thimble came to be God,\" about how we tend to take life for granted and push aside our faith that which truly matter, but also, that there is always hope for redemption.9. Wait Till You See Her. A great rendition of another little known standard.10. Hurricane. Elling takes on Herbie Hancock this time, and the hip results are summed up in the song's title.11. Now It Is Time That Gods Came Walking Out. Another spoken word piece. From the same poet from Elling's adaptation when writing his lyric to Audrey. Some people say this is paying homage to Charlie Parker's cut Now is the Time, but I don't buy it.12. Never Never Land. Okay, who doesn't know where this song comes from? Even those like myself who never actually seen it know that it is obviously from the broadway version of Peter Pan. This showcases Elling's band's ability to to master two different grooves, moving back and forth between the two. Also Elling records his first \"Rant\" (melody and lyrics improvised simultaneously) in which he encourages us to explore our own potential.13. Remembering Veronica. I want to know who this Veronica is if she can inspire a piece like this. The only time I've ever heard anything remotely close is when Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea where doing a spot where they improvised of each other. Elling transforms his scat into a smooth high pitched horn.with the perfect Hobgood accompaniment. A perfect closing song.Let there be no question. Whether you are hip to Elling's sound or you dig another kind of jazz singer. His authenticity is without question. He is a true Jazz Singer.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz", "Bebop"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books", "Travel"], ["root", "Books", "Sports &

This book is based on methods of weight loss that are proven to work. So why buy this book if it doesn't contain a new diet fad? Because it tells you how to do tried-and-true methods as effectively as possible. For instance, everyone knows that limiting carbs is an effective way to lose weight. But this book tells you how to implement lowering carbs into your daily life in a way that is extraordinarily simple. The best thing about this book is that it covers the gambit of what you need to do to lose weight -- from dieting to exercise to sleeping properly to avoiding stress to using a heart monitor.I'd HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is committed to making simple yet effective lifestyle changes that will result in weight loss.", "categories": ["Books", "Health, Fitness & Dieting", "Diets & Weight Loss"], "core_classes": [["root", "Health & Personal Care"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stress Reduction"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Incontinence & Ostomy"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Personal Care"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Lip Care"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Body Art"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Baroque (c.1600-1750)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Classical (c.1770-1830)"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Incontinence & Ostomy", "Absorbent Pads, Shields, Guards & Liners"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Coughing & Sore Throats"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Incontinence & Ostomy", "Protective Briefs & Underwear"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care", "Bandages"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Personal Care", "Baby Bath"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Women's Health", "Menopause"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Cold & Flu Relief"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Lip Care", "Scrubs"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care", "Callus Stones"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care", "Panty Liners"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Incontinence & Ostomy", "Bedding & Furniture Protection"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Personal Care", "Oral Hygiene"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Chest Rubs"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care", "Alternative Protection"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care", "Sanitary Napkins"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care", "Scrubs, Salts & Soaks"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care", "Callus Shavers"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Nasal Sprays & Drops"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care", "Tampons"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Body Art", "Piercing Supplies"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Incontinence & Ostomy", "Bladder Control Devices"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Coughing & Sore Throats", "Cough Drops"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Coughing & Sore Throats", "Cough Syrups"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care", "Pain Relievers", "Non-Aspirin"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Personal Care", "Oral Hygiene", "Toothbrushes"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care", "Odor Control", "Sprays"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Personal Care", "Oral Hygiene", "Toothpaste"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Nasal Sprays & Drops", "Decongestant Sprays"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Cough & Cold", "Nasal Sprays & Drops", "Moisturizing Sprays"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care", "Pain Relievers", "Aspirin"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care", "Pain Relievers", "Non-Aspirin", "Acetaminophen"], ["root", "Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care", "Pain Relievers", "Non-Aspirin", "Ibuprofen"]]}

I bought it after reading all the good reviews and then got to about 10% in and wanted to chuck it because David acts like a total a**hole, treating Marjorie like the dirt on his shoe, comparing her to training a dog and calling her a whore. Repeatedly. The humilation side of BDSM is totally repugnant to me and this was exactly what he was doing. Not cool. And in my opinion even the little peaks that something else was going on with David didn't even make up for his behaviour towards her. After thinking about how this book could get good reviews when he was such a tosser, I figured I would read one more chapter to see if it got any better, and I am so glad I continued with this story. I think it is a testament to MF Sinclair's writing that she can make me give this book 5 stars when I disliked the David for about 70% of the book.

{"asin": "B0096YORV4", "reviewText": "This camera is the coolest thing.Setup was complicated only by the fact we tried to use the button on the router, not knowing if we had WPS or not, to connect wirelessly. Apparently we don't.  So we hard-wired this camera to our router.  Having previously followed the instructions, I had already loaded the software on my PC.  Following the steps in the quick start, I was looking at the room, my router was in, in no time.  But, once this was connected, I could move this camera anywhere in the house and once I plugged it in to a standard wall jack for power, the wireless took over from there.The best thing is when I hooked up my Lorex Ping software for my smartphone and while sitting at work could spy on my cats at home.There are no fees, just a need of a wireless router.  I was wowed.I can take a still shot and even listen to the noise in the house.  You can set up some recording (which would need an SD card),  you can record based on motion detection,  I have not done all that yet, still just  tickled about being able to see in inside my house when I am away.  Another cool thing is that it has infrared, so when there is little light, the camera still works.  It is in black and white, but you aren't trying to match socks when you are using it, so all is good.Needless to say, you don't want to put this in potentially embarrassing locations.I don't know the first thing about security or such, so please rely on the web info for this, or the specs.  I showed this to a developer colleague of mine and he thought it might make an interesting baby monitor or nanny cam.I will write more as we use it more.

Yes, it can be calibrated in the custom mode, and believe it or not, the picture can be even better. For the price, this model can't be beat.

{"asin": "B00009YEK6", "reviewText": "This game is very addictive because it offers hundreds of ways to customize each character. You are able to change the color of the clothing, and add accessories. Accessories such as gold chains, sunglasses, boxing gloves, etc. You can even add new hairstyles. Like giving Jeffery a funny looking fuzzy afro, or giving Sarah long (goldie-locks) curly hair.You can change the screen names too. Whatever you choose to type in, will appear at the top of the screen. Like typing in \"King of Pimps\" for a male character, or typing in \"Sexy Lips\" for a female characters.The game's new Quest mode is a great diversion from Arcade mode. When you don't feel like playing 7 matches which always lead up to the boss fight, you can enter Quest mode instead. In Quest, you will have to meet certain requirements in order to earn points (money) which you'll need to buy the customizations.Lastly, even the Training mode for this game is addictive! You can practice specific moves, in specific combat situations. There is even a slow motion option which helps you to perfect some of the more cumbersome combos. Although slow motion is NOT selectable for the other modes (Quest and Arcade), it looks extremely cool to beat up the training character in slow motion.", "categories": ["Video Games", "More Systems", "PlayStation 2"], "core_classes": [["root", "Toys & Games"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Cases"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Personal Video Players & Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Systems & Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Electronic Toys"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Plug & Play Video Games"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Accessory Kits"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Slot Cars, Race Tracks & Accessories"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Car Accessories"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "SIM Cards & Tools"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Smart Watches & Accessories"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Cases", "Customizable Cases"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Doll Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Coin Collecting"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Dollhouse Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Dolls"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Systems & Accessories", "Electronic System Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Train Sets"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Systems & Accessories", "Electronic Software & Books"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Train Cars"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Doll Accessories", "Clothing & Shoes"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Slot Cars, Race Tracks & Accessories", "Race Tracks"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Car Accessories", "Car Kits"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Slot Cars, Race Tracks & Accessories", "Slot Cars"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Car Accessories", "Car Speakerphones"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Slot Cars, Race Tracks & Accessories", "Slot Car Parts & Chassis"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Car Accessories", "Car Cradles & Mounts"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Doll Accessories", "Strollers"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Accessories", "Track Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Accessories", "Car Accessories"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Accessories", "Tracks"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Accessories", "Vehicles"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Accessories", "Train Signals"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Accessories", "Scenery"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Train Cars", "Locomotives"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Train Cars", "Passenger Cars"], ["root", "Toys & Games", "Hobbies", "Trains & Accessories", "Train Cars", "Freight Cars"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Car Accessories", "Car Cradles & Mounts", "Car Mounts"], ["root", "Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Car Accessories", "Car Cradles & Mounts", "Car Cradles"]]}

It is a great deal for these Rams and they are cheaper than most other big shot brands.Well Let's talk a bit more about this fabtabulous product. It runs my Windows 64bit Ultimate with greater ease much faster than only having 4 gigs. yess I bought 2 sets of these bringing me to a total of 8 gigs. 4 Dimm slots 2 gigs per slot. I am a Photographer and an Artist so I need all the MegaRams I can get. I often do video editing or large digital paintings and I process a great deal of RAW images from my DSLR on my home computer. So you can see why i wanted such KICKASS MegaRams.My computer has 3 hard drives and I pull from them as needed sometimes all three at the same time and the time it takes to accomplish this is a great deal less than before. it can handle BIG tasks faster. Video editing from one HDD, Playing Music from another, all while having Adobe RAW editor and bridge opened. I jump around from task but leave the window or program opened for the others. It helps me think on the next cut while I edit some shots and so on.Render time for ANYTHING is literally cut by half. System boots faster. Photoshop 64bit starts up in about 2 seconds, really! About, very very fast. Installation was a bit difficult being my first time on an install. Tight fit and you have to center them Perfectly before the snaps/clips/MegaRams retainer locking clips secure the memory sticks. if both sides don't click you didn't do it right. You might see them and think they are perfectly aligned but a tiny mm nudge to either side can mean the difference.In closing at 2 gigs per stick and 4 sticks of Rams for me makes 8-Gigs on a 64 bit OS machine. At 32 bits and 4-gigs of ram my memory was always around 46-52% usage and I didn't really have any programs but an internet browse opened. now at 64 bit and 2 sets of this great Rams with iTunes and only an internet browser opened I'm at 18-22% usage. frees up a great deal quite fitting as it is a great deal in my opinion.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components"], "core_classes": [["root", "Gospel"], ["root", "Gospel", "Instrumental"], ["root", "Gospel", "Choir"], ["root", "Gospel", "Traditional"]]}

{"asin": "B000002VC5", "reviewText": "ESSENTIAL ALBUM!!! What an incredible piece of music. Alan Parsons project combines the best parts of prog-rock with the best elements of pop. This album has undertones of Pink Floyd, whom Parsons worked with as an engineer on Dark Side of the Moon & elements of pop, where he was influenced by the Beatles, with whom he had worked as an assistant engineer on Abbey Road.I Robot peaked at #9 on the album charts. There weren't any singles that made it into the Top 200 but that's not an important thing. It was with this album that things began to go right for the Project. It's with this album that certain patterns were established that would continue for the next several albums. The album opens with the incredible instrumental \"I Robot\". This song is very similar to Pink Floyd, best song on the album. Then follows \"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\", a pop-type song with a good lead guitar solo. Then comes the beautiful ballad \"Some Other Time\". \"Breakdown\" is from the robot's perspective. Woolfson writes excellent lyrics. \"Don't Let It Show\" slows the tempo down & is only an average piece. \"The Voice\" is one of the most interesting pieces on the album. It has a distinctive bass line, the instrumental section is very interesting with its strings & subtle sound effects, its tempo change is right on time. \"Nucleus\" is an instrumental that pales beside \"I Robot\". \"Day After Day\" is another average song. \"Total Eclipse\" is another instrumental that's not up to \"I Robot\", it's an eerie sounding piece that definitely gives the listener the feeling of loss & sacrifice. \"Genesis Ch. 1 V. 32\" closes the original album & is another instrumental. This is an excellent song to finish the album, Ian Bairnson once again provides us with a good & appropriate solo. Some may not know the reference of the title. There is NOT a verse 32 in Genesis, chapter one. It's a subtle reference to \"Man created Robot in his own image\" which is why the whole thing was doomed to failure.We've been given five bonus cuts  which give a lot of insight into the making of the album. The first is \"Boules\" which is the demo version of \"I Robot\", it features the clicking of two metal balls (boules is French for balls) that was dropped in the final version. \"Breakdown\", \"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\" & \"Day After Day\" are all early demo versions, interesting in the regard that we can see what the songs 'morphed' from. The last bonus track, \"The Naked Robot\", is the most interesting piece. It's an instrumental culled from all the parts of each song from the album. It becomes one of the best tracks on the album. The bonus track \"The Naked Robot\" is the most interesting because it uses a menagerie of used & unused portions of songs segueing from one to another to complete a stunning ten minute instrumental. But, beware, it's because man created robot in his own image that doomed them both to failure (\"Genesis Ch. I V.32\")The remastering on this album is excellent & the bonus cuts give an insightful view of the songs in previously unreleased rough demo versions that allows the listener to get an idea of how

{"asin": "B002SOKFNS", "reviewText": "Out of the box, the LaCie Starck drive (Starck is the name of the industrial designer who supposedly designed this thing) struck me as totally, completely ugly. And it felt really heavy in my muscular hand. Shaped like a flask and painted dark gray, it has absolutely no style and no class. It feels industrial, all right, but it also feels cheap and weighs like a brick.The drive is quite slow, at least considerably slower than myToshiba 640 GB USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Dive HDDR640E04XRand also my older Seagate 160GB portable drive (no Amazon link available). Also, the drive failed to be recognized by my HP laptop a couple of times, something that had never happened before with this new laptop or any other external drives (except an Iomega ScreenPlay Plus media device). I have little faith in the reliability of this product.Another sin: unlike every other external drive I have used, this one requires you to run a setup program in order to use it! This applies equally to Windows and Macintosh users. I told the setup program to go ahead and format it for Windows use only, and it formatted in the NTFS format, which is fine with me but will be a bane for those still using Windows 98 or earlier systems. Formatting also took a long time, something like 2 or 3 minutes. The slow performance of the internal drive may have something to do with it.The embedded USB cord is very short. While the embedding is an appreciated convenience, it's actually difficult to take the cord out of the recess and to put it back in there. Also, the USB connector itself feels really flimsy, and you can't tell if you've pushed it deep enough into a USB port. It's totally weird.Finally, a short USB cable with a power tip-like connector is included in the box. I tried to use it with the drive, but nothing happened. It's not explained in the quick start guide or electronic manual, either. I suspect it's a power cable, for those users whose laptops don't supply enough power through one USB port. But I have no way of testing it since my laptops all supply adequate power through each USB port.In short, this is a very disappointing product. I got it for free but even so, I don't want to use it, as I don't trust its performance or reliability, plus it's darn heavy and ugly.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Data Storage"], "core_classes": [["root", "Nickelodeon"], ["root", "Classical"], ["root", "Classical", "Chamber Music"], ["root", "Classical", "Symphonies"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Renaissance (c.1450-1600)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Romantic (c.1820-1910)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Classical (c.1770-1830)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Early Music"]]}

I have floss in my purse, car, at home. After eating anything I need to run into the restroom and floss. I also like the gum brushes. So this would appear to be perfect for me, another way to floss!The idea is good, using water to blast out crud- especially for those who for some reason don't like the soothing feeling of floss wound around ones fingers and sliding in between teeth. But something is lacking, power? I don't know, but when I'm done my teeth don't feel crud free and clean.

That's a heck of a warranty by the company if they will replace the product for free if I try to modify/customize it and end up screwing it up due to my own fault.I bought it to add some additional size to the backstrap of the Glock grip. I don't really need the extended tang since the slide has never bitten me.When the package arrived, it was pretty obvious that it's a nicely designed piece. It fits the Glock as if it came out of the GLock plant in Austria. It took all of 30 seconds to install, just by punching out the original pin and inserting the new, longer pin.I've got about 100 rounds downrange now with the Grip Force Adapter on one of my Glocks and compared side by side with another of my Glocks. I can see now why people modify or customize these things.First, I really like the added thickness of the backstrap where the webbing between thumb & finger wraps around the grip. The change in grip angle doesn't affect my aiming or shooting but the extra grip thickness makes recoil control easier.The extended grip tang has some really serious ridges & grooves and these ended up biting me almost like a slide bite. I'm debating using JB Weld or plexiglass epoxy to fill in the grooves and/or getting out the Dremel to smooth out the ridges.For $27, I like the Grip Force Adapter -- especially since it means I can make my pistol fit my hand better without permanent modifications to the frame of my Glock.

The two other singles \"Never Again\" and \"Too Bad\" are also very good songs as well, well-written and about serious subjects. \"Woke Up This Morning\" is a darker song, but it's quite good (my favorite on this CD). \"Just For\" is also a song written against domestic violence, it's another good song. Closer \"Good Times Gone\" is good too, the slide guitar stands out, and it's solid. These 6 songs are definitely worth listening to; they're all good.Now here's the problem. Songs 6 through 9 are forgettable; well actually they're not good. I haven't listened to any of these songs in about 2 years. So the CD is short to begin with, and nearly half of it is weak. In my opinion, Nickelback's other 3 CD's are all definitely better than this one, as whole CDs. So my final rating for this one is 6/10, they get a point for every good song. I'd still recommend it if you're a fan of Nickelback, but their other stuff is better.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "American Alternative"], "core_classes": [["root", "Alternative Rock"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Singer-Songwriters"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "New Wave & Post-Punk"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Compilations"], ["root", "Classic Rock", "Southern Rock"], ["root", "Classic Rock", "Psychedelic Rock"], ["root", "Classic Rock", "Compilations"]]}

{"asin": "B000EN4CVQ", "reviewText": "I had been using a 21 inch high end Nokia Monitor for the past 6 years and did not consider a LCD because I didn't feel that it would compare well with my Nokia, I was wrong.  The Picture on this LCD monitor are actually a little sharper than with the Nokia and although I am still getting used to working on a letterbox display I am happy with the size of the display and it's resolution. There are *no dead pixels* on my monitor which was a small concern for me regarding the purchase. The size reduction was also a nice added bonus, my huge Nokia weighs a ton and is something like 2 feet deep which means that nothing is behind it when it is used. I placed this Viewsonic on the same flexable arm monitor stand that I had been using and now I can swing it around my desk and completely off of my desk when it is not being used.I have better audio for my computer than you get with this monitor so I really don't care about that.

Mine arrived in a huge box because I had a large order with about eight items in it.I tossed the box and while going over the invoice realized I didn't have the Cloth Addiction 2 Pack.

{"asin": "B000002G13", "reviewText": "I remember that at the time when Dragline came out, it was immediately labeled second-class grunge by many critics.  This designation infuriated me since Paw didn't sound like Nirvana or Pearl Jam rip-offs to me.  In fact, I thought these boys from Lawrence, Kansas were just as good as their more acclaimed contemporaries and that Dragline was one of the finest albums of the 90s.  Okay, the follow-up Death to Traitors was a little soft and less inspired, but I'll put Dragline up against your favorite albums from the 90s, and I'm sure it will be every bit their equal.What makes Dragline so great?  Hard, melodic guitars and Mark Hennessey's gravelly voice and poignant lyrics.  `Jessie' always makes me think of the beagle, Betsy, who was a great companion to me growing up - like `Jessie', Betsy was `a good dog' - she used to follow me and the Bishops to Terrace Grocery where she'd sit patiently under the pinball table while we played Tron and Dig Dug for hours.  How can you not love a song like `Dragline' where the boy says to his dad, `Dairy Queen sounds good to me'?  Mark Hennessy sounds like he or someone he knows has had some rather troubling relationships with women if `Lolita', `Veronica', or `One More Bottle' are any indication, but we are the beneficiaries of those tough times since he seems to have used them as inspiration for some great songs.My only chance to see Paw was at a free concert in a park near Times Square in the mid-90s, but the city pulled the plug after only about 45 minutes.  Paw continued to play defiantly, but the audience couldn't hear them anymore.  It was great while it lasted though, and I remember Mark Hennessey ambling through the audience in a big red, white, and blue top hat before the show.  Good times.Paw is one of those bands you have mixed feelings about.  You know they deserved a lot more success than they achieved, but would have been disappointed if mainstream popularity had spoiled them.  The great reviews of Dragline by other people here are heartening to see.  I haven't found too many other albums on Amazon to be as cherished by such a high percentage of reviewers.  Buy it and there's a good chance you'll cherish it too.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "American Alternative"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"],

{"asin": "B0030ZRWW6", "reviewText": "I love these books.  Yes, they can be a bit too pat at times, the characters pretty predictable, but still... delvers, shags, cliff behemoths, river rogues, hook hawks, and many many more - you have to give credit for creativity where it's due!! I've read my share of fantasy and never come across HALF the creatures in this series.  I particularly enjoy the qualities of the delver!That is the ONLY reason I'm still reading them.  The writing is just atrocious. Then is frequently used for Than. Most compound words are separated: he said so any way, she decided to cook some thing, they rose above ground, etc.  It drives me insane.  There's also a lot of redundancy; the author doesn't seem to have a very large vocabulary (or a thesaurus!!): he remains standing among the remaining guards still, etc.  As you see, repeating the word AND re-stating the concept.  If he remains there, obviously he's there still, so why add it to the end and make it awkward?  Also, many sentences just don't make sense.  Either they seem to be missing words, they seem to have extra words, or they seem unfinished.There are still other grammatical/spelling errors, but this is getting pretty long.  As you can see, those things bother me a great deal. Imagine how interesting this world must be for me to continue reading!

However there was a rebate deal that made it almost free, so I said what do I have to lose?Well, for one thing I don't need to walk around with a cordless drill hanging off my tool belt all the time now!  This baby is so handy, I can't believe it.The Good:- It's powerful.  I can drive a 1 inch screw straight into pine with no pilot hole.  More than enough power for most tasks involving screws or nuts.- It's fast.  Basically, if you're using a hand screwdriver to put in or take out more than one screw, you're wasting time and money if you're in the trades.- The Lithium Ion battery holds a charge.  Hoo-ray!  It absolutely drives me nuts to pick up a tool with a Ni Cad battery and find it dead as a doornail because it hasn't been used in a week or it's been sitting in a cold truck all night.  Doesn't happen with this.-It fits in tight spaces.  I was installing crown on the top of a built in book case today so I had 5 inches between the ceiling and the top of the case.  NOTHING short of a right angle drill would have driven those screws had I not had this baby.- It comes with a huge pile of driver bits.  Holy cow, what a bonus.The Not So Good:-Well, the battery isn't replaceable, meaning once this is tool is dead, you can't just pop in another battery pack and keep going. You have to wait to recharge it.But to be fair, come on!  It costs less than [...], what do you expect? I just drop it in the charger at lunch time if I've been using it and I've never run it dead yet. Still, if you're in the trades like electrical, you already own a cordless screwdriver so why are you reading this?I put this down in the category of \"Sometimes you get more than you pay for.\"  5

I am glad I did not see the concert at the Stadium in Paris. It lost some of intimacy compared to the Denver concert. It helped that I was fourth row center stage. The sound recording was not the best on this DVD again compared to Denver concert. Great voice especially in the French sections but even then she was a little weak compared to Denver. Maybe just the shere size of that Stadium.The additional sections on this DVD a GREAT though.  The studio recordings of \" Lets Talk about Love \" and her French Album.\" S'il Suffisait D'aimer \" were truly the best part of this DVD. EXCELLENT. Nice to see the behind scenes and commentaries. I re-play these sections more than the concert.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], "core_classes": []}

{"asin": "B0038L44EG", "reviewText": "I got a great deal on these speakers, just under twenty bucks at BestBuy Canada for use with my MacBook Pro along with a 24\" widescreen monitor. At this price point, I was preparing to be underwhelmed and, to be honest, I was not very pleased with my first impressions of the sound quality. It sounded rather flat with dull highs and muddy bass.Then I remembered (duh) that the MacBook Pro has an equalizer for both iTunes and iDVD (accessed through the \"Window\" menu of these applications). Once I selected a preset equalizer setting (for example, \"Jazz\") the sound quality from the speakers improved substantially! I further custom tweaked the iTunes equalizer using some reference acoustic and vocal jazz tracks and was able to make these speakers produce a pretty nice midrange and clear highs. Moreover, it is actually able to do some halfway decent stereo imaging right on my desktop. (I suspect that it uses a class D switching amplifier chip which are pretty detailed, accurate and have linear frequency response).There is a slight break-in period and treble and upper mids do get smoother after a few hours. Top end treble does roll off, so don't expect audiophile-like bell shaped treble decays from cymbals - remember these are computer speakers! When the sub's volume is set correctly the bass response is pretty decent. It sounds integrated and goes as low as about 90Hz, which is fine for jazz, classical and most kinds of rock - but not, perhaps, good enough for bass heavy Hip-Hop. That said, the bass is considerably better with the subwoofer placed on the floor, as opposed to on the desk.With the Equalizer properly set, I was actually wowed by the sound from some of my well recorded jazz CD's, for example Patricia Barber's \"Fortnight in France\", which includes vocals, piano, acoustic and bass guitars and kick-drums.DVD Movies with good sound tracks also sound great, but I expect these speakers probably won't do well for gaming or with action movies which have a lot of thunderous explosions.So, to be clear, these speakers are NOT suited for loud, head-banging music. If you push the volume beyond medium levels it will start to distort! And don't expect thunderous bass either. If you want a speaker that need to do that, look elsewhere or move up to theInsignia 2.1 Computer Speaker System NS-PCS41 4 Piece With Subwoofer.All in all I am very pleased with my purchase. For those of you considering buying this model, please note the following caveats:- Your sound source needs to be of good quality! For example, these speakers sound much better with my MacBook Pro than with my Acer Netbook.- Make sure you tweak the sound through an equalizer. (iTunes and iDVD on the MacBook Pro have an equalizer).- Position your speakers correctly according to the instructions. There should be no obstructions in front of the satellite speakers. The subwoofer is best placed on the floor.- Definitely use a power strip that has power conditioner to plug in the power adapter. It will considerably reduce noise and make these speakers sound clearer and make more subtle details audible.- Don't crank up these speakers too loud. They are not meant for room filling sound, just for your desk!", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies

SOMEBODY ought to tell him, then.d.)he says Linkin Park uses simplistic chord structures and melodies and layers...whether they're top 40 or not, Linkin Park has one of the most multilayered and densely mixed sounds I've ever heard in my life...and I get paid to review albums.The verdict? this guy is a retard.I think I'm a bit biased, I assumed as much as soon as I heard him pimping Underoath...how someone insults a band for lacking creativity then lists Underoath as a favorite, I have no idea. But that's beside the point. Screw this kid, he has no idea what he's talking about...probably because his sweater is too tight and the blood loss from the last time he cut himself is starting to make him dizzy. As for the record itself, it's very well done. I think the mixing done for Collision Course was a little bit better, but that was done by one or two people, this is an entire rogue's gallery of hip hop quotables and well known alternative musicians and singers. Personally, I could have done without Jonathan Davis on one of my favorite Linkin Park songs, though. I will say that, while I love how far the remixes deviate from the originals, you lose a lot of the feeling put into the originals and the emotion gets muddled by the mixing and cutting and pasting...but it's a good album as far as remixes go. If you like this...check out the Jay-Z/Linkin Park Collision Course album, or the Handsome Boy Modeling School album \"White People\" there's a song on there that features both Mike and Chester, as well as DJ Shadow and someone else, I forget who the other MC is at the moment. But check that out if you love good collaborations.

{"asin": "B0013FYT9Y", "reviewText": "I found Jackie Greene's debut, Gone Wanderin', to be one of the most promising folk-rock debuts in years.  However, I was let down by his next two albums.  Stylistically, he seemed to be in a bit of a rut, and as an instrumentalist, he had a tendancy to just play variations of the same riffs in most of his songs.  I had largely written him off as a flash in the pan, and I probably would not have picked up this album had Amazon not offered it to me as a Vine reviewer.  The kid has grown up and lived up to the promise of his debut.  He is more musically adventerous than on any of his previous works, incorporating a variety of interesting arrays of instruments.  The ubiquitous Greg Leisz's pedal steel is all over this album, as are synthesizers, violins, horns, etc.  Sonically, this album sounds like a cross between neo-folk rockers like the Waifs and Kiko-era Los Lobos.  That latter comparison should not be surprised given the presence of David Hidalgo and Steve Berlin on the album.  However, Mitchell Froom does not seem to have come anywhere near this album (thankfully).  Because of Greene's newfound interest in experimentation, there aren't many times when he sounds like he is imitating early Dylan.  The Dylan comparisons will probably continue anyway, but he is clearly making more of an effort to distinguish himself as a unique musician, and more often than not, he succeeds.You have probably gotten the impression by now that if you are looking for straight-forward folk-rock with a consistent organic sound, this album isn't for you.  However, if you like this kind of thing, try the following:Peter Case, \"Flying Saucer Blues.\"  Peter Case has been the primary denizen of this particular genre for quite some time, and Flying Saucer Blues is my favorite of his albums (Greg Leisz plays an important role on this album too).  However, the arrangements are more traditional on that album.Chris Stills, \"100 Year Thing.\"  (By the way, that's Stephen Stills' son).  I kept thinking of Chris Stills throughout this album.  Chris has a similar interest in folk rock with interesting arrangements.  Chris' voice is fantastic.Paul Curreri, \"Are You Going to Paul Curreri?\"  Paul's first few albums were straight acoustic folk, including an album produced by Kelly Joe Phelps, but on this one, he picked up a Telecaster and started mixing in more rock elements.  Great stuff.The Waifs, \"Sun Dirt Water.\"  The Waifs' latest is somewhat similar to this album, but somewhat more mellow, with more hints of jazz than they have ever included before.Greg Brown, \"Slant 6 Mind.\"  What, you don't have this one yet?", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books",

{"asin": "B008AK8766", "reviewText": "Sometimes you want to use a chopper but don't want to drag out the big food processor- nor wash all the parts afterwards, when you just have a few things to process. I got a smaller version chopper by another manufacturer which I love, but it only holds 1 cup, so using it meant I had to do batches to get the quantity I needed. When I saw that this had a 4 cup capacity, I was very interested! It came in yesterday and I got right to work with it.It does a very nice job of chopping. Depending on the result you want, you might have to pulse it rather than hold down the top. It does not have more than one speed, but pulsing effectively handles that. My smaller, older one did have two speeds but I found I pretty much always used the higher one, so that doesn't bother me. This chopper is not especially quiet - but it's not so loud it becomes annoying.One of my favorite things about this chopper is the way the motor sits atop the bowl with an additional piece of molded plastic between the motor and the bowl. On my older, smaller chopper the motorized top sat directly over the bowl, meaning it was far more difficult to clean. With this, the bowl, bowl top and blade are all easily washable, and also can be put in the dishwasher. My older one came with a separate lid to put over the bowl for storage, but I never used it... this one does not have the ability to be used for storage. That's no issue for me.While this will never replace a full-featured food processor, I find that I use this a lot more than the FP, because it's faster, easier and less work to clean up. And it's the 'right' size bowl. Be aware that the blade is extremely sharp and handle it with caution. Because it's a chopper and not a multi-tasking processor, it is much lighter. As I get older, lifting and moving the Big Processor becomes more difficult.Pros:* works very well for all types of chopping and blending* Easy to clean* lightweight* 4-cup bowl is a great size, accomodates a good amount*  Small footprint means you can leave it on the countertop, unlike a full-featured food processor, which means quick and easy accessCons:* a little noisyFrom my point of view, the only con- a bit noisy- is irrelevant since the Pros vastly outweigh it.  I recommend it!", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books", "Travel"], ["root", "Books",

{"asin": "B0014GXCBI", "reviewText": "I love my TOMTOM!!! I tease my BF sometimes that if it were down to him and my TOMTOM it would be tough for me to choose which I would take on a trip!!! I have used TOMTOM now in three different cities over the past two years and it has been amazing. I used it extensively in Eugene OR and Vancouver WA and also Spokane WA. I have also used it for long distance trips covering several states. I have used it to find my way to work and back home so many times . . . I can't imagine life without it now!! I have never had problems with the speakers - they are always plenty loud! I usually keep it almost all the way turned down now because I'm pretty aware of it when I'm driving and don't need to hear the prompts. If I'm trying to find a new place in the downtown of a city I usually turn my radio off and the speaker up a bit so that I can concentrate more. I love that you can look and see time estimates for when you are going to get someplace and also that you can change the views and what stats are shown. Also love the directions that you can see in text (just like mapquest) and that you can browse the map. Occasionally newer places it wont find. If you are trying to put in an exact address of a place you found and it doesn't have it I just save the cross street and my memory serves well enough the once I'm there I can find it again anyways. The battery doesn't last forever . . . I would guess about two to three hours. I just keep the charger in my car though and have it wrapped over my steering wheel (my TOMTOM is on the LT side instead of under the rear view mirrow) and it is super easy to just plug in the charger when I get in the car so that has never been an issue.

They don't seem to increase flare much- I personally enjoy a healthy dose of backlit-portrait-sun-flare, but these filters don't add to it. Nor do they detract from sharpness, contrast, or saturation.Highly recommended purchase to protect your lenses. Especially in smaller sizes (58mm filters cost a lot less than the 77mm filters I often find myself needing), I have no hesitation going straight for B+W whenever I add a new lens to my collection.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

{"asin": "B000EFDD2I", "reviewText": "I like and recommend these.  The design of the interior of the grip must have changed since 2007 when reviewers complained that they slipped when wet.  Mine have interiors that seem to be lined with a pattern of little suction cups designed to prevent slipping.  You need patience and water to get them on, so plan on about 10 minutes (5 minutes for each grip) to get them on.  They're a good remedy for painful paddlers' thumbs that come from gripping the paddle too tightly.  I would guess that 90% of paddlers who buy Yakgrips do that looking for a remedy for sore thumbs that come from gripping a straight shaft paddle too tightly.  If you have this problem, buy Yakgrips sooner, rather than later, because the bone spurs that form under the callouses on the inside of the thumbs (caused by paddling) take a long, long time to go away . . . and they hurt.Having said that, I have an unscientific theory on what causes paddler's thumb, and I want to throw it out for what it's worth:  It seems to me that thumb callouses and bone spurs are caused by irregular, asymetric paddling, that is, putting more force into paddle strokes on one side of the paddle versus the other.  My thumbs don't hurt after paddling flatwater on a windless day, but after a day of paddling in the wind (trying to combat windcocking) they ache severely.  You can test this theory yourself by paddling in the wind to see whether your thumbs ache equally afterwards.  If one thumb aches more than the other, ask yourself whether this correlates to the thumb you used mainly to do sweep strokes trying to keep the boat going straight in the cross-wind.  If you agree that this correlation exists, perhaps adding a rudder to your boat will help, as the strain of fighting the wind is taken up by the rudder rather than your paddle.  A rudder allows you to paddle more symmetrically in wind and currents.My other observation is that Yakgrips slightly absorb some of the power from each paddle stroke because some of the power of each stroke is absorbed (i.e. lost) by compressing the foam rubber of the grips.  I notice a slight loss of power when using them, but on balance, I'll take the comfort and accept the slight loss in stroke power.  You notice it mostly at first, but some power loss is there.My last observation relates to \"slipping\".  You can stop slipping entirely by butting the Yakgrips against the drip rings on the paddle (if you have them).  If you can slip both the Yakgrip and the drip ring, you're doing something wrong.  I consider the Yakgrips and drip rings a single unit, and together they're unslippable.  If your Yakgrips are slipping and you don't have drip rings, get some and the problem is solved.", "categories": ["Sports & Outdoors", "Boating & Water Sports", "Kayaking"], "core_classes": [["root",

{"asin": "B000001DXH", "reviewText": "For those who couldn't afford to buy the boxed set &quot;To Be Continued&quot;, 1992's &quot;Rare Masters&quot; proved to be a great companion to that set for Elton John fans. Featuring excellent outtakes from 1967 to 1976 (it's a shame that no 1980s' stuff is here), it has 2 discs worth of great music.Disc 1 bgins with his first single. &quot;I've Been Loving You&quot; is Tom Jones - Vegas ballad. Elton wrote the melody and the lyrics. It proves he can write a catchy melody but he needed Bernie Taupin on board to write the lyrics. The rest of the album's first half includes such rarities as the great rocker &quot;Lady Samantha&quot; (covered by Three Dog Night), the haunting &quot;It's Me That You Need&quot; and the thrilling &quot;Bad Side Of The Moon&quot;.Tracks 10 - 19 is the &quot;Friends&quot; soundtrack, available for the first time ver on cd. These are a mixed bag of tracks. Elton and Bernie contributed several great tracks to the movie: the uplifting title track, the upbeat &quot;Michelle's Song&quot;, the luscious &quot;Seasons&quot;, the rokcer &quot;Can I Put You On&quot; and the bouncy &quot;Honey Roll&quot;. These are btter than Paul Bukckmaster's orchestral instrumentals, which are nothing more than well - written crap.Disc 2 is the better. First, there's an eerie alternate version of &quot;Madman Across The Water&quot;. Next, the gospel/rock rave - up &quot;Rock Me When He's Gone&quot;. There's a faster version of &quot;Slave&quot;, which is way better than the &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; version. A piano version of &quot;Skyline Pigeon&quot; bests the &quot;Empty Sky&quot; version by a long shot. &quot;Jack Rabbit&quot; is a jaunty country number, and &quot;Whenever You're Ready&quot; is a great, 1959s - style rocker. &quot;Step Into Christams&quot; is a great Christmas song. &quot;One Day At A Time&quot; is a haunting cover of a John Lennon song that features Lennon. &quot;Planes&quot; is an excellent acoustic song. For this song alone, it's worth buying this collection. Closer is &quot;Sugar On The Floor&quot;, a haunting ballad.I recommend this cd to al Elton John fans. It's a great collection of unreleased material. Also pick up his albums and his live dvds.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Classic Rock", "Album-Oriented Rock (AOR)"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books",

{"asin": "B00064NDY0", "reviewText": "I cant say that it is as good as some of the kitchen aid mixers i have used, and it certainly does not do as good as my kitchenaid stand mixer, but it is very good and mixing things up.It is relatively quiet, and smoothe. though i feel like it bounces a lot, but i dont know if that is just how i am holding it.The style is a bit ugly with the retro jet looking silver vent on the front, but otherwise it doesnt look too bad.I will never purchase one of the super cheap \"sunbeam\" or other off brand again though, as they tent to loose a lot of power and even get messed up and the blades start hitting into each other if you are mixing thicker things.Also the wire type heads are so much better than the wide flat ones that come with the cheap-o products.I also bought a couple of other optional heads as this one came only with the standard mixer heads.One cool thing that was a nice extra is that the chord is on a nice swiveling attachment, so that it doesnt get in the way all the time like it does on other ones.Overall this is a great buy for the money, it was not too much more than the cheap ones you buy at walmart, but it is a good brand, and it seems to be built well.UPDATE:I am updating and lowering my rating a bit now that i have used the mixer for a couple months.First off, i feel the location, size and style of the silve intake hole on the front of the mixer is just terrible. it sticks out a lot, making it very hard to try and mix while adding more ingredients to your recipe without accidentally pooring whatever you are mixing right into the intake hole, this is especuially akward when mixing in a depper mixing bowl. I have already dumped a bunch of liquid into there by accident, even while trying to be careful. luckily the machine hasnt broken yet, but it did make some crazy noises.Sencondly, the mixer is a bit shkey, and i think that the heads and or spinners are a bit unballanced. As you mix it spits stuff out all over the place even when on low seed, and even in a tall mixing bolw, i litterally always have to clean up my walls after mixing anything liquid with it. Also if you are in contact with the bottom of the bowl it is very shakey in wour hand and that is more just annoying than anything else.Again i did take one star off because of these issues, i would still recommend the device to a friend, because of the price, and how well it mixes even very thick things, but i am certainly missing my Kitchen-aid stand mixer that i have in storage in another

While production on Mother's Milk was good, Blood Sugar Sex Magik was totally something else altogether (Get the Funky Monks video and you will see why)Red Hot Chili Peppers: Funky Monks.Like all Red Hot Chili Pepper albums, Anthony was all libido (Suck My Kiss, Sir Psycho Sexy, Blood Sugar Sex Magik), but he still managed to kick out some socially conscious songs (The Power of Equality, The Righteous and The Wicked, Under the Bridge).This album also showed John Frusciante's evolution as a guitarist (all of his solos are amazing, My Lovely Man and Sir Psycho Sexy to name a few). Flea and Chad were also phenomenal.What the Power of Equality started was the coolest journey. Having become familiar with every song the only gripe I could say I have is that I felt that Sir Psycho Sexy should have been the final song instead of They're Red Hot, because John Frusciante's solo at the end of Sir Psycho Sexy made it seem like the closing credits of a movie, which made the whole album play like a movie than a collection of songs.No Chili Pepper album has come close to the beast that Blood Sugar Sex Magik is.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Indie & Lo-Fi"], "core_classes": [["root", "Alternative Rock"], ["root", "Pop"], ["root", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["root", "Pop", "Pop Rock"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Hardcore & Punk"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Singer-Songwriters"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Compilations"]]}

Of course, this might not reflect the average temperature, since I have 2 x 200mm fans on the top and front, 1 x 140mm on the side and another 120mm on the back, in addition to using Arctic Silver (which I recommend in place of the supplied thermal paste). Speaking of, this comes un-applied to the heat sink, so no worries about adding your own choice.Sure, there might be better ones out there (and I kind of wish I'd opted for one with a 120mm fan), but if you're stuck on a budget and you'd rather put some of that dollar towards your CPU upgrade, this is recommended. You might struggle to use the clip, since it isn't attached to the frame, but it works eventually- just RTFM and take your time.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components"], "core_classes": [["root", "Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Game Hardware"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Telephone Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "CPU Processors"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "KVM Switches"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Mounts", "Computer & Monitor Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Crossover Parts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "RF Modulators"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "External Sound Cards"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "External TV Tuners"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Connectors & Adapters"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Distribution"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "Optical Drives"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Mounts", "Projector Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Cable Sleeves"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Cable Straps"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Floor Cord Covers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Telephone Accessories", "Wireless Jack Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Mounts", "Speaker Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Speaker Parts & Components"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Cable Ties"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Telephone Accessories", "Line Cords"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Telephone Accessories", "Handset Cords"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Telephone Accessories", "Headsets"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "CPU Cooling Fans"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "Case Fans"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "HDD Cooling Fans"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "Grills"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "Heatsinks"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components", "Fans & Cooling", "Water Cooling Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Speaker Parts & Components", "Handles"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Speaker Parts & Components", "Case Hardware & Latches"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Distribution", "Distribution Panels"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Distribution", "Wall Plates & Connectors"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Distribution", "Selector Switch Boxes"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Speaker Parts & Components", "Castors"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "Optical Drives", "Disc Duplicators"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Speaker Parts & Components", "Hi-Fi & HT Cabinets"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "Optical Drives", "CD Drives"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "Optical Drives", "DVD Drives"], ["root", "Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "External Components", "Optical Drives", "Blu-ray Drives"]]}

If your trying to get in the mood for Halloween, or just like to read true ghost stories this is the book for you.  Seems like Willow is a ghost magnet, better her than me lol.

{"asin": "B009F1I1C4", "reviewText": "I've had this computer for 7 months, and I should give it 5 stars but there were some slight negatives:1. The automatic disk park problem which caused what was for me a very aggravating constant clicking, which I dealt with by always having to run disapm2, a free download that disables the automatic park.2. I basically like the feel and keyboard and silent somewhat soft and delicate feel of the key-presses, but every now and then don't press down enough and which ends up skipping a letter (or maybe I do press hard enough and it is intermittent variability in the hardware).3. Although I am happy with the quality of the screen, looking at small objects or reading text on browsers, word processors, files, etc. is a somewhat challenging for my ageing eyes. So I can't really say I \"love\" the computer (5 stars)4. Turning off the touch-pad fn-f9 became nonfunctional after a system update or something like that. This is another thing that is very aggravating to me because my palms accidentally contact the touch-pad and the cursor flies off somewhere unattended. From scouring the web I know that this has happened to some other ASUS users. Turns out it appears that downloading/installing the latest Elan touchpad driver seems to have fixed it. But this has happened a couple of times.However I just put in solid state memory (SSD) and viola. With the SSD I rate it 5 stars. A nice plus is that once the screws are off the back case, it pops on and off really nicely like the back of a smartphone.  So as I was working out what I had to do, I could pop the back on and it held pretty firmly without screwing any screws back in. (way easier than back in the day). At first it looked like I was facing a time-consuming nightmare getting the SSD ready to be a system disk recognized by the X202E. But fortunately I found a utility that made it VERY easy (see description of the process below).-------------------------------------------------------------1. Bought a hard drive case (about $10) that converts a SATA drive to have a USB connector.2. Put my SATA solid state drive (SSD) into the hard drive case and connected it to laptop USB port (laptop = ASUS X202E, Windows 8.1)3. Installed and ran \"Paragon Migrate OS to SSD\" which took about 30 minutes to migrate my Windows 8.1 system to the SSD.4. Replaced the original hard disk in the laptop with the SSD.5. The SSD booted right up like lightning - didn't even need to change boot order in BIOS6. Can't tell any difference except the computer is faster.Note: I put the original SATA hard disk into the hard disk case I bought for connecting the SSD to a USB port for migration. I could use it normally as an external hard disk but will keep it as a backup Windows system in case the SSD crashes or becomes dysfunctionalOther reviewer is correct: Paragon Migrate states that it cannot image dynamic drive. But it sure worked great for a standard drive setup. I'm not sure what a dynamic drive refers to but partitionwizard website has a long explanation, which includes this:\"Basic disc and dynamic disc are the two basic hard disk configuration types in Windows System. Most personal computers use basic disks which make the disk management easy. Advanced users and IT administrators may use dynamic disks which are used to improve the performance of computers with several hard disks.\"", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories",

{"asin": "B003VAM32E", "reviewText": "So, I bought a G700 mouse elsewhere.  Now, I had been a Logitech MX user. Those mice are long gone, and needed replacement. Then I tried a Steelseries WOW mouse. That mouse never worked right, the software just didn't do what it said it would. Then I tried a Razor Naga, and that mouse was just wasted - 12 buttons in a 4x3 array on the left side of the mouse seems like a good idea, but in practice it is horrible.  Besides, I wanted a wireless mouse...and thus I decided to try the new G700.The mouse had some great features. 4 buttons on the left, four on top.  None on the right, it could use another two there.  Four buttons on the left side, and a four way pad with a rocker like the Steelseries would have been better.  You know, but not with a poor implementation like Steelseries.The mouse responds like a wired mouse. I have tried moving it, setting all sorts of accelerations and speeds and I can never see any stuttering. In some company literature this mouse is described as having Logitech's shared receiver system. But it was shipped with a receiver that only works with this mouse, and someone asked them a question, and they responded that gaming mice need better performance than a shared receiver system allows, thus, the mouse won't work on bluetooth or a shared receiver system of any sort. OK.So I charge the mouse (which is as simple as plugging the USB cable in) every day. The mouse is dead by the end of the day - and dead means that you move the mouse and it fails to respond without warning.  You switch it off and on and get another minute so that you can finish the fight (maybe) and then you find the wire so that you can plug it in.  The mouse works just like unplugged except that the wire is heavy - you can feel that you are mousing slower with the wire.One reviewer noted that better battery life was as close as getting a decent NiMh rechargable AA battery - I might get 4 and charge them not in the mouse.I play wow.  I used to use a Nostromo N-52 in my left hand, now I use a Logitech G-13.  This is how I have things set up:Left, right, center and mousewheel down: stockG4: bagsG5: mapG6: Levitate (I'm a priest - I can avoid taking a lot of damage when I'm thrown around in a fight or something by levitating, it is an instant cast so I can do it in the air).G7: Alt shiftG8: Bar 1 and target enemyG9: Bar 2 and target friendG10: Escape  (these three are set up like I used to set up the side roller on the MX).G11: A very complicated macro that, in combat, exposes my two AOE spells, holy nova and mind sear, and when not in combat, selects the appropriate mount.Rock the wheel left is attached to a macro which restores my stance, moves me to the combat bar, and has me try drinking an \"endless mana potion\".Rock the wheel right is basically an assist which will target the main tank (needs to be set manually by editing the macro) and assists when there is a target.If I had three more buttons, I'd hang my main combat sequences on them.  Note that I do not have a key for profile shift. The support software shifts to this profile when I use wow.exe.In order to get five stars? With better battery life (I have all the gaming options turned on, but I'm using the default reporting rate) I'd be a lot happier.  A rocker on the right side.The software works as well as I possibly can expect. I am considering using a key to temporarily shift the profile - as a mouse shift, and then I would essentially chord to do things.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables &

The speakers crackled a lot and were very distorted. The woofer was weak and with music where bass should be more apparent, I could barely hear it. I kept adjusting the volume on the bass and still nothing. Overall this system is extremely weak compared to my MacBook Pro's speakers. I had to return these it was that bad. I opted for JBL 2.1 Creature III and was worth spending $50 on those.TL;DR: These are not worth buying if you want some additional &#34;oomph&#34; to watch movies/tv/play games on your computer or console.

{"asin": "B00005AUMV", "reviewText": "This album is a special treat for those who miss the \"little man in black with the short temper\" himself, Glenn Danzig. He's been missing for a few years, well not exactly, just putting out music that is a mere shadow of his former self. But this album does a lot to redeem the \"Classic\" sound of Samhain, Misfits, and Danzig (mark I lineup). Ironically, it has a few of the players of his more current lineup, but none of the lame songs (or psuedo nu metal riffs) that have plagued the man as of late.If you don't already know, it features members of Samhain, as well as the lead singer of AFI. Davey Havok has a fresher, less strained voice (I don't know if its his age or just the production)  than Danzig has had in a LONG time, and his approach is only a testament to the legacy Danzig ONCE had.I really liked this album. It has to be the best thing Glenn has done in years, and he doesn't even sing most of the vocals on it. Its only a tribute to the songwriting talents he used to have, but it makes one wonder, does the \"All songs written by Glenn Danzig\" logo that appears on all his albums except this one really hold as much merit. I mean, with the excellent riffs and dark feel on this album, one must question whether he really wrote EVERY piece of music on EVERY album he's done.Its a well known fact that John Christ and Rick Rubin constructed a lot of the riffs he only \"hummed\" to them or played a rudimentary part on guitar of (in the studio). This has been well documented in Guitar World, among other places.Enough about that though, get this album if you're a fan of any Danzig pre 1995 or classic Samhain!", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Goth & Industrial"], "core_classes": [["root", "Classic Rock"], ["root", "Classic Rock", "Glam"], ["root", "Classic Rock", "Arena Rock"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges"], ["root", "Appliances", "Appliance Warranties"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ice Makers"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges", "Freestanding Ranges"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges", "Drop-In Ranges"], ["root", "Appliances", "Ranges", "Slide-In Ranges"]]}

{"asin": "B003AM7KIK", "reviewText": "I have owned and used this monster for about 5 years.Pros:- The coffee grind is relatively even and consistent. Not perfectly so, just better than my previous burr grinder (a Krups) and far better than any blade grinder. (If you are not aware, blade grinders look a bit like a small blender, and chop the beans into bits. They are cheaper and smaller than burr grinders, but much less consistent. Burr grinders crush the beans between two toothed metal cones or disks, and are much preferred by the coffee-gentsia.)- The grinder is relatively quiet. It is still loud enough to drown out the radio, but not so loud that it prevents conversation. The reason seems to be its heavy, thick construction, and the geared-down motor which turns the burrs relatively slowly.- The straight-through internal path means relatively little ground coffee is  trapped inside, preventing too much stale coffee from building up.- The controls are large, simple and sturdy. The on/off switch is an old-fashioned toggle switch, and is probably user-replaceable(!)- The coffee bin is large and the lid has silicone seal which should keep the beans stored inside relatively fresh. (However, for most reliable results, you should store your beans in a separate air-tight container in the refrigerator, and grind only what you can use right away. I use a glass canning jar to store beans.)- This fellow is massively built, with the impassive countenance of a pre-Loewy locomotive. That doesn't improve its performance per se, but adds to pride of ownership. It is a bit like having a small fire hydrant on your counter.- According to one extremely exacting review, this grinder heats the coffee grounds less than some other burr grinders, again because of the burrs' relatively low speed. I personally do not believe that this is important, because the heating is only a few degrees in intensity, and only a minute or two in duration.Cons- As other reviewers have noted, the ground coffee carafe is relatively thin glass, with no handle. I can grab it with one hand, but I have large hands (I am 5'10\".) It seems destined to be broken, and indeed, I broke mine after a few years of use. I happened to have a coffee mug that fit closely under the output, so that is what I use now.- The bean hopper is shaped so that some beans will stay behind when it empties. If you put in only a few tablespoons of beans at a time, this happens often. I usually just give the machine a shake to tip in those last few beans.- The grind mechanism has a bit of slop, specifically where the adjustment knob contacts the grinding burrs. One can see this by pressing the knob inward, toward the machine while grinding. The knob will move slightly and the grind size will change. This doesn't doesn't affect how even or reliable the grind is, but it does show a bit of under-engineering.Non-cons (criticisms other reviewers have had, but which aren't actually a problem.)- It isn't unusually messy. All coffee grinders create a bit of a mess. (The papery chaff from the coffee beans is especially mobile, floating around like tiny bits of confetti.) This grinder does allow a bit of fine coffee dust and chaff to escape, but not excessively so.- There isn't really a problem with static electricity. This grinder does far better than cheaper grinders made from plastic. If you do get some ground clinging inside the output carafe, just breathe into it gently. The moisture from your breath will help dissipate the static electricity, letting the grounds fall down.Note:This machine may indeed be unable to make the powdery grind required for espresso, I do not know. (I consider espresso a parlous drink made with cheap over-roasted beans, made palatable by adding large amounts of steamed milk, cinnamon, vanilla syrup, etc., etc. It entirely lacks the variety, subtlety and depth of well-made coffee.

{"asin": "B002SSUKOI", "reviewText": "This was my first winsome wood purchase... and am very pleased.  The shelf unit was VERY easy to assemble...took about 30min and was sturdy.  I am using this as a TV stand on the very top shelf...and loaded up books on the bottom two shelves...with rattan baskets on the shelf just under the TV.  I used the remaining baskets with another winsome wood shelf unit that I bought from amazon.The color of the expresso is very dark brown, but looks elegant with the rattan baskets which have a cedar/cherry type weave to them.  I have cherry wood in my bedroom and this was a great way to bring in the dark brown expresso wood without clashing since the baskets had a cherry weave in them.The baskets are sturdy and seem to be strong enough to hold everything from jeans to random lighter items.The wood itself was not as smooth/sanded as I personally would have liked... so after the expresso staining by the manufacturer it had the duller appearance in the places that the wood was rough.  This was easy to adapt to by turning the wood piece over to hide it.  For the price it was worth every penny...

{"asin": "B00007L7ET", "reviewText": "Alright, so I watched the \"Garden State\" preview at least a zillion times, am I a criminal?  Please don't answer that.  After patiently waiting for a month before the release of the soundtrack, I finally escaped into a world of chilling sounds and brilliant vocals.  This film has an amazing soundtrack, but sadly, I was missing the Postal Service song from the teaser trailer.  I had the slower, seemingly methodical version on the album, but I needed that \"toe-tapping\" jam-in-your-car sound that only the Postal Service could provide.  So...I discovered this single album.Hesitant to purchase an entire album without hearing more from this band, I had my record store friend search the world for this release.  I was impressed.  The first song is exactly why I purchased this album.  \"Such Great Heights\" is like poetry set to a beat.  The words seem to flow evenly and demand respect.  It is a catchy song that will shower the light on any dark day.Surprisingly, there were more songs on this album.  I was taken aback by the sheer power and emotion behind the second song, \"There's Never Enough Time\" and was super impressed with another great hit from the Shins.  I am a new follower of their music thanks greatly to the \"Garden State\" soundtrack.  Finally, we went back to the classic.  The song I knew from the soundtrack that completed this entire single with perfection.  This is one of those discs that you would put in your car expecting a short drive, and stay in there all night long.

{"asin": "B006G2XOMW", "reviewText": "This is a paranormal novella written in the first person with protagonist a young woman turned into a werewolf. The voice of the narrator grabbed me from the start because it rang real and funny, and let's face it, the voice is the first thing that captures a reader's attention.The language is plain and clear, the descriptions bare-bones but enough to visualize everything and true to the point of view and the heroine's personality.The main characters of the story were well developed and distinct. Dreama - Dree - the protagonist is a very dynamic young woman, likable and easy to relate to. I liked her both for her realistic but courageous reactions to the strange events around her, her way of taking things into her own hands and making decisions. This is no whiney, screaming female lead; she is a strong person, with opinions (such as on discrimination against women), self confidence but also consideration for the others.PJ, her best friend, is a funny and strong character, there when Dree needs her but also of the more frivolous and partying type. She jumps off the page and adds a humorous note to the narrative. The alpha wolf who takes Dree under her wing is mysterious and quiet and also very real. I felt that I got to know these characters as people in real life.Apart from the good voice and characterization, I really enjoyed the gritty portrayal of Dree's reality as painted by the author. He doesn't mince his words when it comes to the transformation of Dree into a werewolf - the blood, the pain, the fear, the loss of control, the regret. He is exceptionally good, in my opinion, in describing how her body changes each time she loses control of her feelings due to anger or excitement and the way he has the heroine deal with this problem ranges from funny to heart-breaking. I have rarely if ever seen such an honest portrayal of this transformation which is normally glossed over and made into something magical and beautiful. I really liked this aspect of the novella.The book also contains several explicit sex scenes which play an important role in the story as they both help develop the relationship between Dree and a man she goes out with, and provide the ground for her transformations.The character arc is good, with Dree's perception of the world shifting as her body changes, and as she begins to accept she cannot go back to what and who she was. The plot should have been predictable but it had me on the edge of my seat because I was so involved in the characters.However, I admit that I found the last scene too open-ended, the ending too abrupt, so much so that at first I thought this had to be book one of a series. When I checked, though, I saw no reference to a series, therefore I must say this was an issue for me. Too much happens in the last chapters and very little is resolved to call the story finished.I think this book fits well in the tradition of the Anita Blake series (in the sense of mystery, and shifters, humor, and female first person narrator).In all, this was a fast and enjoyable read, gritty and funny, and I recommend it to fans of the paranormal.Note: A Free Review copy was provided by

After all, most things aren't what they are supposed to be these days.Well...  hold onto your hat!  This unit is even better than promised.1.  It is very attractive and extremely well made.2.  It is very easy to store as it locks shut and stands firmly on end.  No worry here about it falling over.  The cord easily wraps around the bottom and has a locking spot.  Must have been designed by a woman!3.  NOTHING sticks to it, even if you screw up your recipe!  I forgot to put the oil in one day and was sure I'd be scraping the mess off the machine until spring.  Nope...  It lifted off as easily as when I did put the oil in the recipe.4.  There are almost unlimited settings on the dial, so no matter how you like your waffles done, there is a setting for you.5.  As the unit heats up the lights show you exactly where it is in the process but no matter.  You don't need it.  It heats up so quickly you don't have time to look or care.6.  Once you fill it the darn thing cooks almost too fast for us and we set it on quite dark.  You can't eat the first waffle before the second one is done.  I don't quite understand how it cooks so quickly but it does.7.  It's also very polite.  The sounds let you know when it's done or heated to your setting without being obnoxious.8.  The results are uniform and the waffles are nice and crisp (if you want them that way).9.  There is virtually no cleanup unless you get your fingerprints on the exterior stainless.If I had one complaint it would be that it's a Belgian.  We prefer traditional waffles.  That said...  It's still worth the price and probably the best machine on the market.The best way to describe this machine is to say it's made in the same quality as an appliance from 50 years ago, except that it has a modern look to it.

I got the white Speck Candyshell and instantly fell in love with it.Now I purchased the case for my Galaxy S3, and I still LOVE this case. The case adds very little bulk to the phone, and actually makes it more pleasant to hold. The glossy texture looks glossy, but it has a nice coating making it easy to hold, so it will not slip out of your hand. The case adds a lip so you can place your phone face down and it will not get scratched. The dual-layer coating adds great drop protection.The volume and power buttons are very slightly harder to press, but not enough to cause annoyance. The power and volume buttons have a very nice feedback that makes them enjoyable to push and you will definitely know when you have pushed them.The one minor flaw is that the case scratches extremely easily. I haven't even had mine for 2 days and there are tons of tiny scratches on the black, easily noticeable in direct light. I had this issue with the Speck Candyshell for my other phones too, but it doesn't bother me too much. If you get the white one the scratches are barely noticeable. Only the black one has very noticable scratches in bright light. This isn't an issue for me though.The case is a little expensive, at thirty-five USD MSRP, but it is a fantastic case.

These X10s are a significant improvement over the rest and worth the extra money (assuming you listen to something beyond 128kbps mp3s).Pros:- I can wear them comfortably for hours.- I don't need to readjust the headphones as I do with others. They don't fall out.- Very tight bass response. The other ones were a bit excessive or non-existent.- Got me thinking about how much better the other more expensive IEMs can be. Curious to try lol.Cons:- PackagingMix these with Spotify Premium (320kbps) and it's just magical. The only complaint I have is that packaging.

{"asin": "B000068NSX", "reviewText": "I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-", "categories": ["Musical

The \"love symbol album,\" as this one is commonly referred, shows the singer at his most enigmatic, hedonistic, self-centered, controversial, and, to a certain extent, spiritual, than anything he produced up to that time, and, perhaps, more than his releases in the last decade.  When he announces \"My name is Prince\" in the first track, the listener should be prepared.  There is truly no one else like the guy from Minneapolis.With backing on vocals and instrumentation by The New Power Generation, Prince has never sounded better and clocking in at just under seventy minutes, there's a lot of good music to behold.The album comes with a \"parental advisory\" for the album's explicit lyrics and that disclaimer is warranted.  Even though many of the songs are populated by profanities, they don't detract from the songs.  In fact, unlike others who need a \"cuss word\" or two to supply a shock, Prince's songs are enhanced by a zinger here or there.  But, mind you, the subject matter is definitely for the adult and caution should be advised when playing around \"little ears.\"Highlights include the aforementioned first cut, the James Brown-like \"Sexy M.F.,\", \"The Max,\" \"Blue Light,\" \"I Wanna Meet with U,\" \"Damn U,\" \"The Flow,\" the gospel-influenced \"7\", and \"And God Created Woman.\"The entire album is a showcase for the funkiness of an artist that has been influential for close to three decades...with many more to come.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Pop", "Dance Pop"], "core_classes": [["root", "Gospel"], ["root", "Entertainment"], ["root", "Gospel", "Traditional"], ["root", "Gospel", "Instrumental"], ["root", "Gospel", "Urban & Contemporary"]]}

Nonetheless, this is still a very worthy VH album overall.\"Mine All Mine\" gets the album off to a catchy, thought-provoking start, and \"When It's Love\" is a typical but strong ballad that was the biggest hit of the album.  \"A.F.U.\" and \"Cabo Wabo\" are fine rockers, the later an epic 7-minute track.  I also like the bluesy, different \"Finish What Ya Started\" (a pretty big hit in its day) and the rocking, heavy \"Sucker In A 3 Piece\".  \"A Apolitical Blues\" is okay.To the negatives--not that I hate any of these tracks, but they simply aren't VH's best.  Sammy screams too much and without real purpose on \"Source Of Infection\".  \"Feels So Good\" (a minor hit) is pretty meek--not as strong as most VH ballads.  \"Black And Blue\" is a bit inane--both in terms of the lyrical content and the too-dragging guitar riff.  (Hard to believe this was the lead single off this album.)  Don't get me wrong--I still can enjoy listening to these tracks; they just aren't as good as most VH and/or Sammy songs.All in all, this album is still definitely worth a listen.  The band still rocks in plenty of places, and Eddie's guitar work is still top-notch.

{"asin": "B000FQBPCQ", "reviewText": "This reboot of the Zelda franchise once again pits the heroic Link against the dark forces of he evil wizard Ganon...dorf. This time, however, Ganon has brought along some friends from a parallel universe, which can only be visited by humans who turn into wolves.So very Japanese.Anyway, goat-herder Link lives a quiet life of simple happiness in the forest of Ordon, until one day a bunch of pig-riding demons invade his home and cast the kingdom of Hyrule into twilight. Link wakes up on the other side, but now he's a dog, with a little Pikachu-thing that orders him around.Long story short, Link will travel over and under the lands of Hyrule, through nine dungeons and countless tasks and side missions in his quest to free his land from the clutches of evil.GRAPHICS: $7Wii games are generally weaker visually to begin with, so it's no surprise that this game, originally designed for the GameCube, does not exactly wow you with its visuals. That said, environments are attractive and fit well with the fantasy theme. It's a big world for you to explore. No frame-rate or clipping issues.SOUND: $7Soundtrack is a little Muzak-friendly, but the scores are rousing and mood-setting nonetheless. The characters do not actually talk, but just make lots of small vocalizations to accompany the onscreen text. Midna sounds like a Pokemon chibi singing the White Album backwards - I expect to hear her say \"hail Lord Satan\" at any moment.GAMEPLAY/CONTROLS: $10Finally, a Wii game that actually knows how to swing a sword. Well, kind of. It still doesn't detect the more detailed motions very well (I really hope the Wii2 improves on the motion detection), but at least you can control your sword by actually swinging it. Camera is good and rarely sticks in a bad place, which is impressive on a system with only one analog stick.GENRE-SPECIFIC STUFF: $10Once again, Nintendo hits the fantasy game out of the park. This quest is very long and fulfilling, with lots of plot twists, side quests and cool items to collect. Even Midna is useful, however annoying she can be.FUN: $10Creatures. Puzzles. Boss fights. Cool places to visit. Tons of unlockables. Everything about this game is a joy to play.REPLAY/VALUE: $10I have been playing this game for almost a year and have not gotten tired of it once. That's all I need to say.VERDICT: $54 out of $60Yes, I know. Wii games are only $50 new, but since I review for other platforms, I wanted to use six criteria for everything. Bottom line, this game is worth the money and then some.

{"asin": "B0000256KG", "reviewText": "As another reviewer mentions here, this album was released several months prior in Britain. As an American, I was lucky enough to get to hear it in the Fall of 72. An older sister of my best friend had been in Britain for several months and came home with a cassette she'd recorded of some bands she was convinced were going to be big soon. This included Genesis, Gentle Giant Manfred Mann's Earth Band and Roxy Music. Roxy may have not been as technically proficient as the others, but they more than made up for that with sheer audacity. They mixed a bit of prog  (albeit a bit sloppy) with some 50's stylings, campy glamour, the exagerated vibratto of Brian Ferry. Add Brian Eno's &quot;I'll toss in this irrtating noise and see what happens&quot; approach. The result is one of the freshest sounding records of that or any other year for that matter. The production is rough and the playing a bit sloppy, but that is part of the overall charm of it. Things would really come together more om the next album. &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; which really puts them on the map as inventing &quot;New Wave&quot; about 4 years before the term was even coined.

{"asin": "B00000DR5H", "reviewText": "It is funny that if OMD are remembered at all it is above all as an electronic pop band who produced catchy singles. Not all of these were good- Tesla Girls, Secret and Telegraph are abysmal songs by any standard. OMD for me were always much more about experimental and highly original albums. In terms of experimentation you don't get much more radical than this album. It is hard for people today to understand just how original it was at the time. Electronic music is not a style which ages well because, based partly on technological progress, it is always likely to be superceded by better technology later. The novelty with OMD at this point was their reliance on 'emulators' which had first come to public attention with that song 'Wonderdog' (who remembers that now?). This was a group with a highly developed sense of technological possibilities (they even made their own synthesisers). They were prepared to play around. 'We don't make fillers, just interesting failures' claimed lead-man Andy McCluskey when this album came out. Not all the experimental songs worked but 'This is Helena' ('Music for your tape recorder, we hope you enjoy it') was a classic of the genre. The second single off this album 'Genetic Engineering' is, in my book, their best ever single. It is the only one of the singles that hint that behind this pop band there might be a desire to explore uncharted territory. Ok, one can object to the message of the song but musically it was brilliant combining experimentation with catchy poppiness. The under-rated album also contains quite a few of their best ever album tracks: 'Romance of a Telescope' and the Joy Division rip-off 'Silent Running'. I know it's not hip to say anything good about OMD but in the genre they were working in they were easily the best.

{"asin": "B001QW6LMW", "reviewText": "I'm sure that whenever I'm out of earshot, my two dogs are grumbling to each other that, \"If mom really loved us, she'd give us Summer Brushtail all the time.\"  Tough luck, pooches.  Unfortunately, Addiction's Summer Brushtail dehydrated raw dog food is only for small treats or special traveling time in our household.  With over 140 pounds worth of dog flesh in our family, the 2 lb box only lasts us about 2-3 days--way too expensive for daily use for my big eaters.  A couple of years ago, a pet food store in our town was offering special deals to try out some of their new inventory.  I made the huge mistake of bringing home a box of this food.  And so began their fixation.  Granted, I could just refuse to buy it; but it is fun to see how excited they get when I set a new box of it on the kitchen floor for them to sniff.  I guess I still don't get what the big attraction is...but both my guys are complete idiots when I bring it out.  It's not like they don't regularly get other dehydrated raw meat/veggie mixes, plus fresh poultry, bison, or salmon mixed in with their food.  But NOTHING gets the reaction that this stuff does with my two.  Those little Brushtail possums must be pretty darn tasty.My dogs get the occasional dollop of this on top of their other food; but mainly I use it for when we go on all-day hikes or on road trips.  It's convenient to pack and so easy to rehydrate the mix with water...just remember not to use hot water or you'll undo the benefits of the raw diet.According to Wikipedia, Brushtail are invasive, destructive marsupials that are destroying conservation area in New Zealand.  So, what do they do?  Stick them in dog food, of course.  Unfortunately, they're also rather cute, sweet-faced little things, so I now sort of wish that I hadn't looked on Wiki.  Addiction offers other varieties including one called Outback Kangaroo Feast.  Although I recognize that kangaroos are overwhelming pests in Australia, I happen to think fondly upon roos and can't bring myself to feed them to my pooches.For those who like to know exactly what

{"asin": "B007B5TPVM", "reviewText": "After buying from Philip's GoGear line, I thought I would be happy with this model as well. It does have extended storage with 16GB, however unlike the model I purchased 2 years ago, this one does NOT support FLAC. If you want to place lossless files on this player, you must use the WAV format, so the extra RAM doesn't allow much more than the 8GB that plays FLAC.The recording feature has been improved over earlier GoGear models, allowing to record from the in FM radio. The video feature is completely worthless, and I personally think they should have used the firmware space used for video and implemented more codec support, such as AAC and FLAC. The DAC and audio stage seem to be typical bargain line quality.I never can understand why they will try to implement things like video on such small devices, yet leave out more important features like audio format support.I personally wish that these manufacturers, marketers and vendors would stop using MP3 synonymously when talking about portable music players and downloadable music. MP3 is the WORST sounding of the currently popular music formats. I personally have built my collection directly from CDs and vinyl using the completely lossless FLAC format.Overall if you are content with the artifacts and hollowed out sound of the MP3 format, it may be for you. If you appreciate listening to the intricacies and have a lossless (or even AAC) music collection, you will probably find this player a disappointment.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Digital Music"], ["root", "Digital Music", "New Age", "Celtic New Age"], ["root", "Digital Music", "International", "India & Pakistan"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Miscellaneous", "Wedding Music"]]}

{"asin": "B00EH0E744", "reviewText": "&#8203;Title: Man OnAuthor: Liz CroweGenre: m/m romance&#8203;Review:Man On, written by Liz Crowe, tells the story of the Black Jack soccer team--the newly assembled soccer team that boasts the first openly gay player in pro sports. I found the premise of the novel interesting, as this touches base with topics being dealt with today. The novel is mostly told from two character's point of view:  Nicolas and Parker (also known as Doc).&#8203;Nicolas used to be a super star soccer player in Europe, but his not so stellar behavior has left him somewhat stranded. So he decides to jump on board with the Black Jacks as the poster boy for gay pro sports players. Nicolas knows he will be facing haters and critics once he openly declares his sexuality but luckily, his team mates all seem to take it in stride. Maybe just maybe, Nicolas has found a good team willing to accept him.Parker Rollings was supposed to be a doctor. His parents has already planned out his whole future: go to medical school, marry his girlfriend, make some money and settle down. The only problem is that Parker doesn't want that type of life. All he ever wants to do is play soccer. Yet, he's always been the perfect child and his parents expect him to abandon his passion and go to medical school; so, it's a surprise to everyone when he breaks up with his girlfriend, ditches college and joins a new soccer team with an uncertain future called the Black Jacks. Oh, and there's one more little problem: Parker thinks he might be gay but isn't sure. But what he does know for sure is that being gay in pro sports is a big \"no-no\", so he does his best to ignore this little fact and temper it down.&#8203;As I mentioned before, I found the whole concept of introducing homosexuality into pro sports and the ripple effect it would cause to be interesting. However, I felt as if there wasn't enough written about the reaction of the public to Nicolas' declaration. Instead, I felt as if a whole lot of the story was focused around Nicolas' affair (maybe 50%?) I personally found the book to be rather heavy on the romance aspect of the story. I think I would preferred it if the author also wrote more about the \"big picture\".The action was fairly fast paced and and there were some unexpected events that popped up. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good romance or m/m romance story. This was a good quick read just not particularly my taste.Stay tuned for an author interview with Liz Crowe coming up soon.Likes:&#8203;  *deals with a somewhat controversial topic*fast paced*dynamic

I own a Gamecube and a PS2 but I rarely touch my Gamecube because the games I like for it aren't much. I only own 4 games (including this one). I got Zelda Wind Waker, Eternal Darkness, MGS Twin Snakes. There was so much talk about Metroid Prime being great and all, but it looked like a first person shooter mainly so I wasn't that interested. I finally decided to purchase this game to give it a try and big surprise, I love it. First off, it doesn't feel like a FPS, it is incredibly fun and the exploration is adictive unlike WInd Waker which I found annoying compared to Ocarina of Time. The jumping system,... it is unbelievable the great it works!!!!  The areas are huge but everytime you aquire a new upgrade for your weapon, morph, visors or suits, you want to go back to reach some places that you couldn't earlier. Even if this game doesn't have too much story, you won't get annoyed at all by that. The fun of this game will make you forget this point.

Always loved them, but had one complaint - they didn't hold enough water to fill my 12 cup coffee maker.  Always had to refill and wait to make a full pot of coffee.  So when I saw this, I thought it was just exactly what I wanted.  So why the 2 star review, well...One star is for the size - it holds enough for the coffee maker and then some.One star is for the style - this thing looks good on my counter.The MINUS three stars - it drips at a high rate of speed if there is any water left in the upper reservoir.  It doesn't matter how tightly you hold the lid, the water still comes rushing out because it doesn't fit tight enough.  (On the older, cheaper ones, you could hold the lid in place and nothing dripped).For me, this is a major design flaw because it means, quite simply, you cannot pour a glass of water until all the water in the top has filtered through to the bottom.  Which puts me right back to the cheaper models - waiting for water.I wish I hadn't throw out the old one - because, this is so aggravating, I know we'll buy another cheaper one next time we go shopping for drinking water and just reserve this one for filling up the coffee pot.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Water Coolers & Filters"], "core_classes": [["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Folk"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

{"asin": "B000GIO9BW", "reviewText": "I've had the pleasure of using both machines for many years.I used to work at Robeks where they swore by the Blendtec, and my mother beams a Vitamix.  I use both frequently, the Vitamix now more since I don't work at Robeks any more.My verdict is that like others have wisely stated, you will be a winner with either of these machines. However, depending who you are and what your requirements are, there are slight differences. The major points are:1.  Vitamix outperforms the Blendtec. It is very slight, but I never have to bang my Vitamix against the counter like I had to with my Blendtec blender because how well it dices all the ingredients.  Don't get me wrong, Blendtec still will put your home blender to shame.2.  The Blendtec looks nicer than the Vitamix. It is true. I will probably end up buying the Blendtec when I finish college simply because it is more compact and it looks great (the blue light!).3. Sound? Well, like that other guy stated, you won't hear any aircraft taking off and it's not one for a mother who is always trying to put her baby to sleep haha.  Still, the results justify the noise. It's to be expected. I would have to say that the Vitamix is slightly quieter, because when my room door is near shut, I cannot hear it from the kitchen (we live in close-quarters in Hawaii).  With the Blendtec, you can be in a whole other store in the mall and best believe you will hear the smoothies grinding (it's a selling point apparently, who knew?).That's about all that matters to me. They both produce delicious smoothies and in record time. As in regards to whose warranty is better and so on, I've heard Vitamix has a better policy but it's not something I've ever researched because these machines are like the Hondas of the smoothie world. They are work horses and they last forever! At Robeks, they never get the blades sharpened or the machines tuned up. My mother's Vitamix has never given her problems to date.I am more familiar with the operation of a Blendtec and produced better smoothies with it (because of the formulas), and I kind of enjoyed banging top against the counter. It made me feel like I was working for this smoothie's perfection! haha", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies

Like most children, there is almost nothing they love more than sitting next to an adult on the couch and looking at the pages while the adult reads a children's story to them. So what a perfect find this book was.It is an amazing undertaking. For the publisher to seek out what is probably every version of the Cinderella story and then compile it into one perfectly formatted and beautifully illustrated collection. It's no wonder that at the time of this writing, Cinderella: The Ultimate Collection is on several best-sellers lists. It makes me wonder how long it will be offered at such a low price.I wish this enhanced version for ebook was available when my children were small. There are 29 versions! You could read each night to your children and when you are finished with one version, you could continue on to the next one. You may even want to ask your children which version is their favorite. As for adults like myself, my children are grown, but that's why they invented grandchildren. As an added bonus, if I get too tired to read out loud, I can click on one of the free, full-length audio recordings of different versions of Cinderella and listen to a professional. In summary let me say that whether you are reading to your children, or your grandchildren, or if you are just a kid at heart (you may even be interested in the historical aspects of this fine collection), I highly recommend this five-star collection.", "categories": ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction"], "core_classes": [["root", "Classical"], ["root", "Entertainment"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods"]]}

The price was higher than other brands, so I was expecting a high-quality cable; But what I got was a very very thin cable, thinner than any other of the cables I had. When I plugged it in, I noticed some problems with the signal and always have static when the cable moves a little bit. Go to your local music store and buy a good cable 'cause this one is total waste of money. If you're planning to use it for booming, better buy an XLR cable with 3.5mm adapters and you won't regret it; It's longer and you can't beat that quality.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Accessories

Loved how some of the levels reverted to its 2d roots out of no where, really added nostalgia that only a older gamer who played the first versions wouldve recognized. The naked picture fragments of his girl were an awesome addition, as well as the fact that the three original titles were unlockable to play thro the story mode, that was especially awesome to me since i never owned a sega master system and never had the joy of playing the original installment of this series. I reccomend this game strongly to any fan of the original series, and to any fan of bloodsport beat em up games, its very exiting challenging and interesting.

{"asin": "B00A4EWS4S", "reviewText": "OH NO! There's blue snow on the ground this Christmas, and Jake blames himself for it. Last night, Jake woke up and saw a beautiful snow globe by his bed. He then wished for snow and an exciting Christmas day. Now look at what's happened - BLUE snow!!! The very weird thing is, it's only on their street! That is strange! Jake meets Eric (don't you love that name ;) ), the elf, who takes him to Santa's ship (his modern sleigh) and meets Santa. Most of Jake's family didn't believe in Santa but Jake did. Santa explains to Eric how he accomplishes everything he has to do on Christmas Eve. Santa also tells Jake that his future will be changed forever (but in a good way).This Christmas story is a great read for kids and adults. I thought the story plot was very unique. I thought the part of the story that tells you that you have to believe to see things (like snowmen are really alive). It is a nice more modern story for the holidays. It has a lot of funny parts to it. I really love Ms. Palmer's Alice Parker series and this story is written just as well.

{"asin": "B002NKLREI", "reviewText": "I've owned a Zen X-fi, microphoto and a few others variants for a while now. I stick to Creative for quite a bit of my audio electronics. The Zen X-fi2 has been my favorite mp3 yet by them.Design: The player is pretty sleek and thin, not too bulky in my opinion. Even with the leather case sleeve on it, it's still not overly large. It's lightweight and the black/silver combo is a nice visual. No Complaints here.Interface: This is where most of everyone's issues are and it isn't flawless by far. The touchscreen can be finicky, it's better since firmware updates but still glitchy and can be slow. The lock button and home button are nicely placed however, and work perfectly. The menu is attractive, and is pretty nicely customizable, although I haven't changed the default layout much, it suited my preference. I don't believe its mentioned in the layout guide when you purchase, but if you hold the home button, it will quickly pull up the volume control (I read some complaints saying that there was no quick volume control access). I also recommend using your finger nail on the screen, it will control much better than just your finger. Interface is par, not very impressive.Video/Photos: I've uploaded some of my photos to my Zen, the picture is nice and it's much better than I expected but it's nothing compared to a computer/laptop etc. I haven't put much on, just some photos here and there and background photos to customize the menu wallpaper. I have a few live shows from some of my favorite bands or music videos just to get the other versions that don't come in a mp3 format. I've watched a few and it's not a bad picture but can't give you the picture of a computer or tv. It takes a lot of space for the videos too so I try to avoid clogging up memory with them.Audio: This is why I buy creative and will continue. I was skeptical of how much of a improvement this would be compared to the original zen X-fi. But after listening, there X-Fi and Expand features truly have improved. The given earphones are better I feel as well, more comfortable and better quality. Now with the x-fi turned off, the audio is good but nothing spectacular, I still believe it sounds better than a I-pod Touch even without X-fi.Now with it on, it's unbelievable. The expand feature creates surround sound much better than its original. I have this option maxed and it hasn't moved since. The Crystalizer is the key feature here. It will deepen the bass and really bring out the highs, especially making cymbals much more crisp. It could be my earphones, but the treble stands out much more than the bass, so after experimenting with different Crystalizer settings, i found roughly 70% on the bar is enough to make the treble how I prefer it, but the bass still staying booming.I have shown many friends who own Sony mp3s, I-pods etc and all have agreed the sound beats them. Probably some of the best songs to test this was on one of my favorite bands Pink Floyd. Comfortably Numb, Echoes, Shine On You Crazy Diamonds - all great songs I found to show the different. On Echoes I could hear David wet his mouth before singing the next line, even the slide sound when moving his fingers across the guitar strings. In short, the zen was pulling out sounds from all my music that I couldn't even hear with other devices/systems. The external speaker is pretty good quality, just not very loud - I don't use it much anyway, I almost always have my earphones/headset on me.If you're looking for a mp3 to improve your music and listening experience, the zen x-fi2 is what I strongly recommend. If you're looking for a mp3 that can run apps, games, and has good interface and audio isn't a main concern as it to just have something to listen to your music, i wouldn't suggest this.On a side note, I also purchased a 16gb Sandisk SD card for a great price from amazon and it worked with no trouble on my Zen. Went from a 16GB to 32Gb for a great price.Thanks for reading, hope this helps.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root",

Secondly, if you do not have the lid snapped on tightly EXACTLY as designed, and I mean EXACTLY, unfortunately the coffee maker still \"thinks\" it's all right to make the coffee: when you start to pour, it goes all over the counter.

{"asin": "B00GXPTRKU", "reviewText": "I&#8217;m on the fence about this card reader. On the plus side, it&#8217;s wonderfully compact. It&#8217;s only about 1.25 inches wide, 2.25 inches long, and about 3/8 of an inch thick. It&#8217;s perfect for traveling &#8211; I can just toss it into a camera bag or laptop bag without it getting tangled up with anything else.The downside is that the attached cable is pretty short. It&#8217;s less than 7 inches from the tip of the USB connector to the base of the reader. It&#8217;s a good quality cable, with a sturdy connection to the card reader, but it&#8217;s just a little too short for my ease of use. Then again, just having a cable is a plus &#8211; I really hate the readers that plug right into a USB port. It&#8217;s always a struggle to get them to seat properly on my laptop unless I use a USB hub.The reader itself feels solid. No problems getting SD and micro SD cards in it. It has a power indicator light at the top to confirm it&#8217;s properly connected. It has a total of 4 slots &#8211; two on the side and two on the edge, and can read/write to 2 cards at the same time.Zero problems with installation (no drivers needed) and it worked fine on both USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports.I won&#8217;t drop the rating for the short cord since that does play a role in keeping this small and easy to carry and MUCH easier to use than the readers that plug directly into a USB port.

{"asin": "B000002L6L", "reviewText": "What a difference twenty years makes.  In 1964, the young Quincy Jones arranged superlative charts for an album with Count Basie which included two tracks that went on to be Sinatra staples: &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot; and &quot;The Best is Yet To Come.&quot;  The latter song's title foretells the opposite of this collaboration: what was to come were the single worst batch of arrangements in the Sinatra canon.  Only &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; stayed in Sinatra's concert set list, and with Satchmo, Ella and Bobby Darin unable to complain too much the song became Sinatra's property by default (after all, Bobby WAS trying to be like Frank when he sang it).  The rest of the cuts, especially the title track, suffer from &quot;smooth jazz&quot; arrangements that are simply bland.  Like Burt Bacharach's work around this time, the urge to sound contemporary in a Light AC Radio sort of way overshadows these proceedings for the worse.  Listeners might also be put off by Sinatra's deepening voice and propensity to project his vocals on every take (Tony Bennett has this same problem these days, only worse: he shouts at full volume at the start of *every* song and is obligated to a BIG finish at the top of his lungs.)  On all the tracks, they're sung with full force almost as if he's belting out these songs; no delicate phrasing here.  With the digital compression, added reverb and other processing, Sinatra's vocals have no dynamics whatsoever.  This is especially obvious during &quot;How Do You Keep The Music Playing&quot;, as the soft piano intro is soon greeted by Frank's bulldozing vocal reminiscent of Vaughn Monroe or Frankie Laine shouting in a canyon, and destroying the mood.  The sad part about this is that since he can't tackle the frilly love songs, he could've sure swung like mad with a blastin' big band back behind him.  But noooooooooooo!  Quincy's gotta show how much of a cool cat artiste he is (even though he farmed out most of these charts) because he produced &quot;Thriller.&quot;  He shoulda taken out his old LP with Frank and Basie and used that as a guide.  A serious mis-step for all involved, redeemable only because even at his worst, Sinatra is the best there ever was.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Broadway & Vocalists", "Classic Vocalists"],

Lots of \"one-hit wonders\" too, from groups including the Brooklyn Bridge, 1910 Fruitgum Co., The Youngbloods, The Lemon Pipers, and The Friends of Distinction.  There's something for everyone!As I stated earlier, the price is definitely right on this 30-song collection.  So, even if you're only looking for 2 or 3 songs to fill out your '60s collection, this CD should meet your needs.  For those that are looking to start a '60s collection, jump on this CD fast while it's still in circulation.Perhaps the most important comment I can make about this album is that EVERY song is the original cut from the original artist.  No \"re-makes\" or present-day re-recordings of these songs.  No \"Buyer Beware\" warnings for this CD.

{"asin": "B004443WQM", "reviewText": "I got this as an unexpected Christmas gift last year and have been loving it, for the most part. What really kills this excellent ode to geekdom is the app. I've been using it for just about 7 months and I still have yet to figure out the mystic button pressing required to get the app to synch the disc lights to the music. I generally stumble on it after two or three tries and can't remember in what order I did what. Or maybe, as I'm seeing in other reviews, it just takes a bit for the dock to recognize the iPod. Since you have to download the app, there's no documentation for it. But it looks so simple, you wouldn't think you should need any!As far as I can tell, you can't use the app with anything but playlists or the currently playing album. You can't access Shuffle from the app...Shuffle! This is a basic music function that should be readily available.The synch lighting (when it works) is great especially when used in a dark room because the lights are bright enough to light up a good sized room on their own. The sound is fantastic overall and fills up the room nicely. If the option to synch the lights to the music had been a simple button option on the dock or remote, I'd give this 6/5!", "categories": ["Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Digital Music"], ["root", "Software"], ["root", "Software", "Music"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Pop", "Easy Listening"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Miscellaneous", "Poetry, Spoken Word & Interviews"], ["root", "Digital Music", "New Age", "Celtic New Age"], ["root", "Software", "Video", "DVD Viewing & Burning"], ["root", "Software", "Video", "Video Editing"], ["root", "Software", "Video", "Compositing & Effects"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Miscellaneous", "Wedding Music"], ["root", "Software", "Music", "MP3 Editing & Effects", "MP3 Software"]]}

A record where you can actually hear what he's trying to say to you.  An  album like this can only be made by a handful of people in this day and  age...because most cookie-cutter country singers don't have the material to  sing in this fashion, they are not capable of writing the intricate lyrics  that Yoakum writes and they don't have the heartfelt emotion to pull off  the songs successfully.  Can you really imagine such a gutty album coming  from Tim McGraw or Shania Twain?  It would never happen, it can't happen -  because they lack the skill to write, play, and sing these types of songs  are much better suited to looking pretty for a video.This album is a bit  of a reminder of Willie Nelson...reworking his old tunes in a new way, and  looking at them from a different angle.  Funny how immense talents like  Nelson and Yoakum are driven to do creative things like this with their  music...and then on the other hand, later this year we'll get yet another  record from George Strait that sounds like the last 8 records he's made.

I buy these expensive toothbrushes because my teeth stain terribly and I get terrible tartar.  Only these toothbrushes can spare my teeth most of the harm.I noted the following differences/similarities between the Sonicare and the Panasonic Sonic toothbrush:1.  Both have long battery life so the toothbrushes don't need to be recharged for days at a time.2.  Both reduce tartar and stain much, much more than standard toothbrushes.3.  Both have various settings on it--but honestly, I just use the regular setting each time.4.  The Panasonic Sonic toothbrush feels lighter than the Sonicare but I haven't weighed both separately to confirm this fact.5.  The Panasonic Sonic costs approximately $60 less than the Sonicare DiamondCare.I gave the toothbrush 4 rather than 5 stars because I have yet to figure out how much it costs to replace the brush heads.  I contacted Panasonic by phone and by email to find out details for the replacement brush heads.  The Panasonic representative I spoke to didn't have an answer and the email response I received was similarly unhelpful.  Clearly, I'm hoping that the brush heads will cost less to replace than those of the Sonicare.  I replace my brush heads at least monthly, so their expense figures in considerable to the cost of the toothbrush.

I could drive along the Interstate highways for extended periods of time (30 minutes to  1 hour) without having to change the transmitter frequency, and finding new frequencies was a simple task.  I have found the ~95 and 101-103 frequency ranges to be the mostly likely to work.

{"asin": "B004432SVI", "reviewText": "I am a semi-professional photographer. Get paid occasionally, but It is at the very least a full-time hobby. And I also am finishing a B.A. in Photography. I bought this specifically as a \"toss in the glovebox\" camera to always have with me when I was not around any of my camera gear, and to take location scouting for various projects. Overall it is an excellent camera, with surprisingly easy controls (I'm not a gear nut so this is the only \"enthusiast compact\" i've ever had, but from what I can tell it is pretty awesome).I paid just over $500 on eBay for it. The $799 price tag is pretty steep for any camera of this type, and since all the other reviews say that the Panasonic camera this is a rebrand of has the same image quality/controls, then I'd just buy that, unless you can find a detail on the Leica version. Having the Leica version is nice because it inspires more confidence when I meet with someone who is paying me money to take pictures and sees me whip out a point 'n' shoot at a location.... more so than the generic looking, generic named panasonic. I also found a non-leica leather case on eBay that is an absolute MUST for this camera. Felt lined, two-piece, it looks incredible for about $50 shipped.The photo quality is impressive, especially from RAW (I have never seen a reason to shoot jpeg out of any camera... why cheat yourself out of editing headroom). I've done some serious  \"damn it i framed way too wide\" cropping, I mean like taken the middle third or quarter of the image, and the images are still sharp enough to use at least in web page form, large file size. Don't get too hung up on megapixels. 12 is more than enough for most things. I print up to 24-36\" on the long side, and I've made 12mp look great even at poster size. So don't talk yourself into spending an extra grand on a camera with 16-18-20+ megapixels just because you get buyer's fever. My 18mp Canon EOS 7D makes moderately sharper prints at those massive sizes, but I have printed an image from my D-Lux 5 almost that size, and I doubt anyone but me could tell they were from different cameras, and then only because they were deep focus landscapes where everything was in focus. It really doesn't matter what resolution your photo is if it has thin DOF and most of the photo is blurry anyway.The little aperture/shutter speed adjust dial by your thumb is small, but works great considering it is almost invisible. in Aperture Priority just rotate the dial to adjust aperture just like an SLR (ditto with shutter speed in S-mode). Press the little dial in (like a button), and you have quick access to exposure comp. ISO and white balance functions are quick access.The rear LCD looks pretty good, but these days all of them look pretty good. Not worth mentioning more.Focusing is about as fast as any newer point-n-shoot, which is about average I guess. It is disappointing if you are used to DSLR optical autofocus. Contrast detect AF just plain sucks, and even when camera manufacturers try to improve on it, they can only make is suck slightly less. That's just the rule of the game at today's current tech level. The F/2 lens gives pretty good moderately shallow DOF considering the size of the sensor, with decent bokeh. Some of the best you will see without seeking gear that is designed for good bokeh and short DOF (I.e. full frame sensor camera, LEICA R glass, etc)Besides the high retail price, the SINGLE issue i have with this camera, is that if I turn it on with the lens cap on, It just keeps asking to remove the cap. It doesn't look like you can just go into playback mode to quick browse through the images. You have to take the cap off, which I think is a waste of time. Why not have a simple menu item to change this, because I can't be the only one who turns their camera on to look at the pictures frequently (or to show an image to someone else). It is a pet peeve, but I judge my gear pretty harshly if it interrupts the pace I work at (especially if i pay over $500 for a damn tiny camera only to have it bug me to remove the lens cap when I don't even want to take a picture)So I gave it FOUR out of FIVE stars for a combination of the high price, and for the lens cap annoyance. Other than that, i LOVE this camera. I find myself always taking it out of the case and handling it when i'm at rest and I have the camera with me.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Digital Cameras"], "core_classes":

For this album they all plugged into the mixer and recorded it at once... There are some over dubs but man, oh man.... How they did this as a live track is beyond belief)Now that I have that off my chest I'll get to the review....Most Hardcore/Metal-Heads have already been familiarized with \"Silent Circus\" or \"Alaska\" but this is what started it all.  These eight songs combine pure madness, beauty and chaos.  For a debut this album showcased some serious potential... And I'm glad to see they have exercised that potential on their more recent albums.  However this album had a raw, energetic feel, which can only be captured when a band does a live recording.  Even though this album may not be quite as good as there newer material, it is a fantastic debut which gets at least 1 play every few weeks.Favorite Songs:  Arsonist, Use of a Weapon, and More of Myself to Kill-4.5 StarsIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:\"Was this review helpful?\"", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Hardcore & Punk"], "core_classes": [["root", "Hard Rock & Metal"]]}

Obladi Oblada, another awesome one, that never gets old. Apperntly this is reggae... I don't see it. Anyway. While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Great song, somewhat dark, with Eric Clapton helping George out on guitar. Martha My Dear is also a great piano song. I Will is also a great song. Although the first disc holds pretty bad songs like Wild Honey Pie and The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill.The Second Disc: Birthday is a pretty good rock song. Helter Skelter. This song is great, but insane. This is not your typical Beatles song at all. Although what is a typical Beatle song? This is a hard, grungy, metal song, screamed by Paul. Honey Pie is a very nice song too. A bit 40's I guess it would be. Revolution 1 is pretty good. And now comes the controversial \"song\": Revolution 9. Waste of space on this album. A 9 minute+ track filled with random noise. I gave it a chance. The first few minutes were interesting, but when it comes down to it, this is a ridiculous thing to put on The White Album.This is a fair album, just for the mentioned first few songs on the first disc.

{"asin": "B00EO96W2I", "reviewText": "Wow, I really love this projector. Picture quality is amazing, 3d is unbelievable good, much better than theaters, in fact, you can't even compare the both. I am totally in love with this thing. For the price I truly believe it is one of the best projectors. Here are the big pluses, it is bright even in a lit up room, the picture quality is amazing in blu ray and when using PC, relatively cheap considering all the features you are getting, $20 for the 3d glasses as it does work with Samsung glasses. In fact, I actually borrowed my brother's samsung 3d glasses for the first weekend I had my projector. On top of that, the replacement bulb is only 99 dollars, way lower than any other projector also lowest of all Epsons. This really was the big one for me, I could have afforded the 1500 Epson but I read the bulbs on it blew faster and it costs $240. Screw that. The remote also works great and the on screen menu is easy to use, also it worked my Panasonic blu ray straight out of the box. A few cons, I don't like the keystone adjustment, I played around with it a lot but don't find it all that impressive or beneficial, also I am sort of a videophile and the slanted picture annoyed me. I am also new to projectors so I don't know the alternatives very well. It doesn't have lens shift so adjusting and aligning it against the wall it is kind of a pain. Heard some people complain about the fan but I didn't really seem to bother me at all. I think having lens shift on it would have helped quiet a bit. I have it sitting ~14 feet away from the wall and it displays a screen size of nearly 140-150 inch, which is massive at 14 feet, so I think they did a great job. This is like one of those items that somehow a manufacturer makes that so good for what you pay that it is almost hard to believe.

This involves hunting a shape-shifter whose blood he can drink and assume its powers. But not everything goes according to plan. Cole excels at establishing mood through vivid description, making the reader feel like we're right there alongside his first-person narrator, and in this story, I felt transported back through time to the late nineteenth century.

{"asin": "B00C1GBOU6", "reviewText": "Call the genre whatever you want (art-rock, post-rock, experimental, ambient, downright tasty), Iceland's Sigur R&oacute;s is one of the best bands of the current generation.  Big claim, I know, but Kveikur only solidifies the band's stature as one of the genre's best.  If you like Sigur R&oacute;s, go ahead and pick this record up.In past years, Sigur Ros has been criticized for having a \"formula\".  If you're a fan of the band, you probably have some idea of what this formula is: soft, atmospheric music, swelling chord changes, and a gigantic build up that leaves the song on a massive crescendo.  Perhaps the band has been aware of their critics.  Since 2008's Me Su &iacute; Eyrum Vi Spilum Endalaust, the band has retreated from their past \"slow-burn to explosive finale\" tendencies.  Their 2008 record found the band attempting to write more conventional pop songs (well, what would be pop for Sigur Ros, I suppose), and 2012's Valtari was an exercise in decrescendos.  Valtari (a record I love), was created around music starting somewhat big and working its way down - the album even ends on a 3-song streak in which each proceeding song is a bit softer and a bit more minimalist than the last.  For this reason, coupled with the loss of multi-instrumentalist Kjartan Sveinsson, I was prepared for a minimalist exercise with Kveikur.Earlier in the year, the band released \"Brennisteinn\" as their single to promote Kveikur.  This feels a bit misleading (not dishonest though) - the single doesn't really represent what the album sounds like, but rather, it indicates that Sigur Ros is still tooling around with their sound.  To put another way, the rest of Kveikur doesn't sound like \"Brennisteinn\" - instead, it seems to be an assurance that we aren't getting another Valtari, or another ( ), or another Von.  Because this song leads the album, it starts Kveikur off with a near-industrial crunch.  At almost 8-minutes, it's one of the most unexpected turns for the band.Similarly, second-released single \"&Iacute;sjaki\" isn't as representative either.  &Iacute;sjaki is busy in ways that most of Kveikur isn't, and Jonsi's vocals constantly keep the melody moving along.  But these two singles together tell the story of Kveikuer perfectly - many of the moments on Kveikur are characterized by poppy melodies thrown against a jagged backdrop.  The title track for example has Jonsi singing incredibly catchy vocals over distorted electronics.  These moments give the album's cover (a boy holding an old gas mask over his face) some context.  Other tracks like \"Yfirbor\" and \"Stormur\" try to strike a similar balance, with Jonsi staying squarely in the spotlight this time around, rather than letting the music play on without him like we've seen in past releases.The band continues toying with its sound, so there is plenty of new things to hear here though.  Musically, this record feels like a mix between Me Su &iacute; Eyrum Vi Spilum Endalaust and Valtari - these songs are perhaps a bit more straight-forward than the Sigur R&oacute;s we are used to, but every song is loaded with a healthy dose of atmosphere.  By the time the closer \"Var\" comes around, it feels like we can finally rest.  It's a quiet, ambient track that gives listeners a chance to reflect - so much of Kveikur is loaded with business, it feels somewhat relieving to have this moment before circling around back to \"Brennisteinn.\"If you haven't liked anything you've heard by Sigur R&oacute;s so far, you probably won't find much on Kveikur to change your mind.  For fans of the band though, this album is a must-hear.  Don't let the lead track \"Brennisteinn\" scare you away - there's plenty here of the band you know and love, but there's also plenty that you've never heard from them before.  This might be my favorite of their's since 2005's Takk...Notable tracks to download/sample: \"&Iacute;sjaki\", \"Yfirbor\", and \"Kveikur\"", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Alternative Rock", "Indie &

I know, it's a minor detail, but...Sigh.  They're pretty, and I haven't used the pan yet (because I'm debating if I'm going to return it), but they are definitely smaller than I expected, and I wouldn't have purchased them had I seen them in person first.  I guess I was looking for a \"medium\" sized cake pan, and these seem quite small to me.  Not as small as an individual serving size, and that's another problem.  How to serve these?  I would guess that a normal sized portion would be somewhere between a quarter and a sixth of each finished cake.  Which wouldn't sit well on a plate.What I *do* think this would be perfect for would be a little girl's tea party.  So, when you make a normal bundt and have extra batter, your little one could have their own cake.  Kind of like when my grandmother would make pies and let me make a tiny one with the leftover crust and filling.I Edited, and took a star away.  I decided to make cakes in them yesterday, and they are MUCH too small to be practical.  They're even too small for when I bake and give away cakes to the neighbors during holidays.

{"asin": "B004OVEVOC", "reviewText": "I really, really wanted to like this TV, but it has some serious faults.First the good:3D is amazing. Passive 3D is the most comfortable, bright, and attractive option out there. I have owned Active 3D sets in the past, and this is truly the future.  I did not notice any scan lines, or distracting artifacts when watching 3D as some have noted.  The colors truly do pop, it's a fantastic set for kids and a large group of people to enjoy 3D.2D...It's a roller coaster ride, plain and simple. Biggest fault is the light leakage, the drawback of an edge lit LED television.  It didn't bother me at first, but after a week, I'm sending it back.  All four corners leak light in black scenes, and on my TV, white 'clouds' of light poked through the middle of the set.  It's a rollercoaster because, when the movie/game is actually playing, you don't notice it behind the image.  The image is very, very good, in these times.  But when playing a letterbox movie, or navigating a black screened menu, it rears it's head, and it's truly ugly.Another aside is the off angle viewing. I've noticed that if you're not sitting directly in front of the TV, the light spillage is more apparent coming from the opposite side.I didn't expect inky blacks, but the light spillage was something that truly turned me off, and got in the way of enjoyable letterbox movie watching.However, other than the light leakage, I found the colors to be very good, the settings very good, and the image was plenty bright.  The glossy screen did not factor in at all, just don't have a light source behind the couch where you're sitting and you won't notice anything.Second fault, game playing.  Plain and simple, I cannot play Modern Warfare 3 at the same level that I could play it on a Plasma. Even when setting the input to PC, which reduces the lag noticeably, it was still never as responsive as a plasma would be. However, when you set the input to PC, the picture quality drops slightly.  I was a little disappointed to find out the excellent contrasty picture I had spent fifteen minutes setting up would noticably wash out when I enabled PC mode to my input.  Something for you games to consider with this TV.In summary:1. 3D is amazing, the best I've seen.2. 2D is very good.3. Light leakage is very bad, clouding is apparent in black backgrounds.4. Lag can be tweaked to be good, at the cost of picture performance.If all you do is watch 1.66/1 films and 3D, get this TV. Nothing compares.  If you watch letterboxed movies and play video games on a regular basis, I would advise a plasma display.UPDATE: Paul's TV does NOT take back non defective TV's without a 15% restocking fee, and a $100 delivery charge.  Buyer beware when using them!UPDATE2: The 'white clouds' disappeared when I took the provide lint free cloth and gently massaged the screen, apparently it occurs when the screen presses against the backlight during shipping. It is funny that the people at LG or Paul's TV never recommended this simple solution.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"],

{"asin": "B000003TK9", "reviewText": "Guaranteed to offend just about everyone, Patrick Sky's \"Songs That Made America Famous\" is one of those rare albums that will never be forgotten by anybody who hears it.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this record, however, is that it has held up so well since it was first released 30 years ago. Oh, some of the more topical songs about the war in Vietnam are no longer as relevant as they used to be, of course, but most of the satire still succeeds brilliantly. And it is to Mr. Sky's great credit that he pulled no punches in being an equal opportunity curmudgeon who used humor to attack the hypocrisy of both his critics and his fans. Feminists, racists, Catholics, Jews, rock stars, and yes, even protest singers, are all fair game as targets of Patrick's wrath.Many of the tunes on this CD are disgusting, obscene, perverted, and sick, but most of them are also boldly hilarious, outrageous, and full of the sort of viscious dark comedy that is sharp enough to make you split your sides laughing. And it shows with crystal clarity how much the popular musicians of today have retreated into the safety of the bland and timid kind of cultural commentary that dominates our inhibited modern marketplace now. In our current PC environment, who would dare to create a fictional character named Blind Funk Earwax and interview him for a song called \"Child Molesting Blues\"? Who would risk being labeled cruel to the handicapped (I mean, disabled) for playing a track like \"Ramblin' Hunchback\"? Who else would challenge his audience to recognize the bigotry, fear, and narrow-mindedness within themselves, and then turn around and make fun of himself as well? As the late Phil Ochs once observed, humor can be a very powerful weapon that makes a deadly serious point, because it catches listeners when their defenses are down. In the hands of an artist as talented as Patrick Sky, that weapon was deployed with devastating effect.Although I feel I must take off a star to account for the fact that some of the work here has lost a bit of its punch with the passing of time, \"Songs That Made America Famous\" remains one of the best albums of its type ever recorded. Imagine putting Lenny Bruce together with an acid-crazed Tom Lehrer, and combining that with the most articulate and scathing rants of Bill Hicks, and you will have some idea of what to expect from Patrick Sky. Your ears will burn and your sense of decency will be shocked, but you will also be smiling if you have any capacity at all to laugh at the absurdity of the human condition. And that alone is reason enough to give it a spin and check it out.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Folk", "Contemporary Folk"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root",

{"asin": "B00B9HHAGK", "reviewText": "THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS ROCKS! So does Mattel's Batman Unlimited line for releasing the hulking reinterpretation of Batman by Frank Miller as seen in his phenomenal graphic novel, The Dark Knight Returns.This figure does justice to the other installments in the line by its sheer accuracy and attention to detail. The articulation mimics the current He-Man line (which I think is really impressive for a classic kid toy design). The points of articulation, while numerous, tend to be restricted by the figure's bulky muscles, which is kind of a given if you see the elbow joint range in images. The joints are rather tight save for the abs, which seem to be flimsy. The cape is a slightly flexible plastic, which is kind of a bummer if you want the cape to be... like a cape. The only included accessory is a Batarang. It's not a quintessential Batman design, but it's definitely going to appeal to those who've read or watched the Dark Knight Returns stories. The pros and cons are as follows:+ Batman has a great range of motion in his abs and lower body for kicking or running poses, though the knees are single-jointed.+ This Batman has a spot-on face sculpt and a faithful design of the costume used+ This figure stomps the DC Direct version to pieces by being more proportionately appealing and boasting more articulation.- Batarang is the only accessory, and doesn't fit too naturally in Batman's hand... so give it to another Batman figure!- This figure begs to have some double-jointed areas for dynamic poses. However, there IS the Play Arts Kai option at a steeper price (But it's very stylized in favor of the Japanese toy design and the Arkham City video game, though that's not too bad)Overall, I'm so glad I bought this toy. It's a serious figure from a mainstream company, which I applaud after seeing so many mass-produced garbage toys cascade through shelves these days.

A fan said &quot;I love you, Jewel&quot;, and she responded, &quot;Shut up, you punk!&quot;  As a result, several people returned their signed copies of her poetry book for a refund.

The title track is Grover Washington Jr.'s signature piece, a punchy jazz/pop fusion that always delivers. \"Black Frost\" is another groovy number which closes out the CD. Even though the program consists of just four tracks, the music creates a nice atmosphere to relax and enjoy a master performing at the top of his game. Grover Washington Jr.'s music will endure forever.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Jazz", "Smooth Jazz"], "core_classes": [["root", "Jazz"]]}

There are 2 plates and 6 pieces of food.  The food is shaped so that it fits into it's match on the plate.

The Resistance is going to war with the Netherworld.If you read Wuthering Freights - you know you have to read Malice - you just need to know!!Another solid book from HP Mallory!", "categories": ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction"], "core_classes": [["root", "Automotive"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction"], ["root", "Books", "Humor & Entertainment"], ["root", "Automotive", "Performance Parts & Accessories"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Mystery"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Drama"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Thrillers & Suspense"], ["root", "Automotive", "Performance Parts & Accessories", "Motors"], ["root", "Books", "Humor & Entertainment", "Pop Culture"], ["root", "Books", "Humor & Entertainment", "Radio"], ["root", "Automotive", "Exterior Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["root", "Books", "Humor & Entertainment", "Television"], ["root", "Automotive", "RV Parts & Accessories", "Covers"], ["root", "Automotive", "RV Parts & Accessories", "Lighting"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "War"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Mystery", "Supernatural"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Thrillers & Suspense", "Suspense"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Thrillers & Suspense", "Supernatural"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Mystery", "Women Sleuths"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Mystery", "Hard-Boiled"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Thrillers & Suspense", "Crime"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Contemporary Women"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Single Women"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Sisters"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Women's Fiction", "Mothers & Children"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Mystery", "Supernatural", "Witches & Wizards"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Thrillers & Suspense", "Supernatural", "Witches & Wizards"], ["root", "Books", "Mystery, Thriller & Suspense", "Thrillers & Suspense", "Crime", "Organized Crime"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Horror", "Occult"], ["root", "Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction", "Horror", "Dark Fantasy"]]}
{"asin": "B009OZUPUC", "reviewText": ">>Received item 06/12/2014>>Initially 4 starsInitial slight issue:I did the manual setup initially(without using WPS), both the iPod and Nook connected without issues. The Toshiba Tablet sees the SSID, but could not authenticate, until I rebooted the tablet(I think the issue is more with the piece of junk Tosihba tablet than anything else).Samsung UN60F7100 LED 60\" Smart TV:I tried connecting the smart TV to the extender, but to no avail. Until I spoke with D-Link's tech support personnel ID AR004204, he suggested first upgrading the extender's firmware from 1.1something to the latest 1.21B01 RevA2(must search online for it and not rely on the self latest firmware check). They said that some of those TVs will not work, possibly due to different frequencies that those TVs are using, since the DAP-1320 uses 2.4Ghz, while some TVs uses 5.something Ghz. Looking at the specs on my Samsung TV, I was not able to find out what Ghz it was using, but right after updating the firmware on the extender, the TV suddenly started working with the extender. Then I also updated the TV's software to the latest and it's still working just fine. All is well now, happy!Down stream test with Nook & Android Tablet:Connecting the devices directly to the router from about 40 ft away, I was getting an average of about 3-5 Mbps. Set the extender to different locations(not the sweet spot) and gotten the same result. Then moved the extender a little closer to the router at less than 40 ft(finding the sweet spot), now the devices are getting an average of 12Mbps, even at 40 ft away.Conclusion:Maybe a little confusing to setup at first, but once you figure out that sweet spot, it's all good. One thing you need to know, is that once you connect your device to the extender, it's gonna get the transmission strength from the extender and not the router(e.g. If you are connected to a router that is a few feet away from the device, you obviously will get better reception, but because you are now connected to the extender that is further away, the reception is not as good, but that is the compromise of being more versatile with your device at different distances. Or, just switch between the different SSID, depending on where you are going to be at).I know what needs to be improved to make an ultimate product, but I need to be paid as an high end CEO with a golden parachute before I can give my advice.>>UPDATE 6/16/2014The android tablet sees the SSID, but just could not connect to it, even after rebooting the tablet. I had to unplug and plug the extender back in to the outlet to make it work again. I've read other reviewers having similar issues. So far, as long as it does not happen too frequently, it's all good.>>UPDATE 6/18/2014>>Downgraded to 2 starsWhy? Mainly the portable Wi-Fi devices will see this SSID with strong signal and when trying to connect to it, it just won't and will automatically switch back to the previous connected SSID. I had to unplug the DAP1320 AGAIN to make it work, now this is just happening a little to frequently.

{"asin": "B00B8L36A6", "reviewText": "I don't have and don't plan to have any Apple (iPhone/iPad/iPod) devices, but I bought this charger because the description says, \"Simultaneous, full-speed charging.\"  Unfortunately, that's only accurate if (a) one of the two devices is an Apple device or (b) the max charging rate on one or both devices is only 0.5A.  I bought this because I wanted to charge two Nexus 7 tablets at something close to full speed (knowing at best I'd get 1.8A each since the max output is 3.6A, but when I tried it out I was getting less than 0.5A on the \"Apple\" port (despite what the description and many reviews say).  When I looked at the paperwork that came with it, there was a table for charging rates for the two ports, where much to my disappointment I discovered that the rate for \"Android phones\" and \"Other devices\" was listed at a measly 0.5A despite the port supposedly putting out 2.4A, which apparently only applies to iPads.  iPhones are limited to 1A on either port.  I've posted a scan of the table in the customer images section.On the plus side, the build quality is excellent and the customer support after the sale was phenomenal.  If I were trying to charge both an Apple and an Android product at the same time, this would likely be an awesome product.Bottom line is that although this didn't meet my needs and expectations, as long as you know what you're getting you should be quite happy with this.  I'm taking off a star for the inaccurate/incomplete product description, but if they can get it updated (and let me know about it) I'll give that star back.

For example, this last time I updated the firmware I was having major issues getting the box to turn back on after I turned it off. Very strange. I would do a hard reset, then have to put all my settings back in. After doing this twice I started messing around more with it and realized that if I unplugged and replugged the HDMI, it'd work again. I thought it was a bug in the latest firmware, but lately it's been working just fine. Anyway, point of the story: upgrade firmware at your own risk. Don't fix it if it ain't broke kinda thing.- Occasional crashes. It's not an Apple product, it's made by Western Digital.

{"asin": "B00BWIWYBW", "reviewText": "I love that I have the option of removing the fluoride from our water supply with this filter! Is a bit of a pain to initially install, I always find it difficult and cumbersome to rinse out the product with my sink's faucet design and have to empty a couple of tanks of water from my Berkey to get clear water no matter how much time I spend rinsing these, so it takes an entire day of messing with it to get our filter system back on track. And be very very careful not to over tighten these onto the screws or you will ruin them, you will not feel increased resistance or anything like that, just one gentle twist too much will do it.  Much too easy to accidentally ruin these in my opinion. Certainly they should be designed to screw onto the correct point and then stop? Seems kind of silly to me to be so easy to overtighten....Once on though they work great, glad to have that fluoride level lowered. I see a definite negative impact on my children's health when they are drinking fluorinated water regularly. And the only time they had any problems with cavities was when they were drinking fluorinated water also! I'm sure there were other factors involved in the cavities, but the lack of fluorinated water has certainly not affected their teeth adversely, no cavities at all in the years we have used water without fluoride added to it.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Water Coolers & Filters"], "core_classes": [["root", "Health & Personal Care"], ["root", "Folk"], ["root", "Health

In fact, truth be told, this is a far superior collection of songs more essential to add to your collection than the previous.\"He Touched Me\" is a very moving song, and not only gives you chills from her flawless vocal performance, but also from the easily relatable lyrics.  I give it an A\"The Shadow of Your Smile\" is an example of light jazz, similar to \"In the Mood for Love\" on her Movie Album.  Stunning.  A\"Quiet Night\" is brilliantly arranged with understated music, and sung with Barbra's powerful voice.  Very beautiful.  A-\"I Got Plenty of Nothin,\" taken from her poor medley on My Name is Barbra, is the first song where she seems to \"have fun.\"  Nice song.  A\"How Much of the Dream Comes True\" is very pretty, but it's the first song on the album that doesn't capture your attention.  Not very catchy.  C+\"Second Hand Rose,\" a sort-of Barbra Streisand standard, is, like track 4, more campy and tongue-in-cheek than other tracks, but is very enjoyable.  A-\"A Kind of Man a Woman Needs\" is similar to the songs on her Simply Streisand release, where it's above average, sounds pleasing, but just doesn't compare to her at her best.  But it's still a worthy track.  B-\"All That I Want\" is unsure what it is trying to be, a silly song or a show-stopping ballad.  Because of that, it gets a C+\"Where's that Rainbow\" is another smooth jazz song, which while a bit off-putting at first, but really takes you into those classic bar scenes in movies as it goes on.  Not the best track, but not the worst either.  B\"No More Songs For Me\" is another lifeless song, which doesn't capture your attention much.  CThe \"Poor Medley\" that concludes the album is pretty good.  Admittedly, without the visuals from the My Name is Barbra special, it misses something, but for a souvenir of the special, you can't get better.

{"asin": "B00E8CF0CE", "reviewText": "There's two types of personal cloud: entry level network attached storage (NAS) and these portable cloud solutions. NAS in general is not portable- it either is combined with a full size desktop router (e.g. Apple Time Capsule) or hooks up to one via ethernet cable. They all use AC power and have the advantage of being pretty fast, file system independent, can be mounted as volumes, and often including massive storage or expansion bays. Most of these are designed for use with full-up computers rather than smartphones or tablets.Devices like the Apotop Wi Copy are different animals. They have onboard power supply, are small and light enough to carry around, and broadcast their own network. These are mainly designed for use on the go with mobile devices rather than computers, though many can be used with both. I've had the chance to use both this and Seagate's Wireless Plus, which is a direct competitor. They have a totally different feature approach to the same problem which is worth comparing:Apotop Wi Copy:Has a SD slot and USB port for USB drives/USB external HDDs (USB 2.0)Can use both SD and USB simultaneously and transfer between bothNo direct hookup to a PC or any obvious way to connect it (possibly pending functionality?)Can be used as a charger for smartphones and other USB-charge devices (works while broadcasting wifi)Ethernet jack for hookup to a routerNo Mac support. Attached HDDs formatted Mac OS will show nothing.Other notes: It does not appear to support USB on-the-go, so as far as wired transfer options go this device seems to be pretty much a no-go. This isn't a huge problem, as you can just plug the media in to transfer stuff and then plug it into the unit.Seagate Wireless Plus:Has an integrated hard drive (1 TB) with external connector (USB 3.0). No expandable memory.Can be hooked up directly to a PC via included USB-&#62;SATA connectorMac support via Paragon NTFS (included)Other notes: This unit is quite a bit larger and heavier, since it has a full-up 2.5&#8221; hard drive in it. It's also probably a lot less durable since standard hard drives don't take well to being dropped.Both units broadcast their own network and can act as a wireless bridge with an existing network. This allows them to act as a repeater (though probably not the fastest one) and allows you to access the internet while accessing the storage. They both can be configured with standard encryption. Both have a simple file browser for viewing pictures, music, videos, and the likes. Both use apps for mobile device access. They seem to have similar broadcast range.As far as the app access goes, it's a tossup between the two. The Apotop app seems to be a lot faster at showing thumbnails and loading lists of files, but it seems slower at streaming- it struggles streaming HD even at short range. The Seagate app has better search features and streams faster, but is very slow at loading previews.In comparing them, I have to say I prefer the Apotop overall. It doesn't have Mac support but you can just use FAT-formatted USB/SD for that. With the external HDD support you can hook up a pretty big drive and swap it out if necessary, giving you theoretically unlimited storage. The Wireless Plus has a large built-in storage but once it's full, it's done. The ability to use the Apotop as a charger is nice, as is its smaller size and lower weight. It generally works well hot-swapping cards and drives. The versatility this device has makes it a winner.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Routers"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books",

{"asin": "B00K667VLO", "reviewText": "There is nothing wrong with this short book. It covers the basic information about how and why to crate train a dog, but I found the same information free on the web when I started crate training our dogs when they were puppies.One thing I disagreed with the book about was the size of crate to start a puppy in. The book says to get one big enough the puppy will still fit in as it grows. The crate has to be small enough so the puppy feels like it is his den in order for him not to go to the bathroom in the crate. A friend had a White Highland Terrier and bought a huge crate about 4  foot square so the puppy would have room to run around in. The puppy would soil the crate then run around in it getting his feet and body really messy. She complained about needing to give him a bath every day. About a year later we babysat the dog and he loved his crate. He no longer soiled it and didn't even bark once he was in it at bedtime. I think it would have been worth the money to buy a smaller crate for the puppy then get a bigger one as the dog grew.With out puppies we used a hex pen which is a six sided metal mesh pen that can be clipped together to make a hexagonal pen or folded up when not in use. We kept the puppies in the pen and each had their own crate inside the pen to sleep in (we took the doors off). When they got old enough not to need the pen all we had to do was say &#34;kennel&#34; and they would run into their crates and we could shut the doors if needed like for a trip to the vet. Otherwise they were happy to sleep in their pens at night without the door.

What a disappointment. The newer Aspire One has eliminated the extremely helpful CapsLock pilot lamp, an omission that makes typing harder. Now you have to click on the CapsLock key and an icon flashes on the screen telling you if you are ON or OFF CapsLock. Thank you very much Acer! In addition, the box contains absolutely no instructions other than how to connect the netbook to power. Not even a simple Quick Start Guide explaining the various machine parts and ports. Lastly, the acclaimed AMD \"fast\" processor does not make computer operations fast. In short, this machine is unexpectedly SLOW, but--to be fair--perhaps some of it is due to the poor performance of Windows 7, as I explain in the next paragraph. Acer started as an extraordinary company but its great initial success seems to have caused them to simply rest on their laurels, with little regard for their customers' needs.But Acer's omissions play an off-key second fiddle to Windows 7 Home \"Premium\" (ha!) deficiencies.

In this particular netbook, not only are Windows 7 difficult to use, but are malfunctioning too. For instance, several times I reset the taskbar clock and each time the darn thing goes back to what it wants.Thus, I am using the new Aspire One only when I have to, and do the bulk of my computer work using the easy, infallible original Acer Aspire One netbook with Windows XP.I wish I could split the stars: Give 3* to Acer and 1* to Microsoft for their disastrous Windows 7.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components"], "core_classes": [["root", "Classical"], ["root", "Pop", "Vocal Pop"], ["root", "Pop", "Adult Contemporary"], ["root", "Pop", "Adult Alternative"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods"], ["root", "Classical", "Compilations"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Modern, 20th, & 21st Century"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Early Music"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Romantic (c.1820-1910)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Classical (c.1770-1830)"]]}

We are still hunting for a place to put such a large decoration, and if I had realized it was so big I might have bought the one shaped like a wine bottle instead.

{"asin": "B000002HC3", "reviewText": "Sound Of White Noise is Anthrax's first album with former Armored Saint vocalist John Bush. This was also their first album released after thrash metal hit the mainstream with the release of Metallica's Black Album. Although grunge was in full swing in 1993, real metal bands like Megadeth, Metallica, and Anthrax actually had their biggest successes. In fact, this would be Anthrax's only album to make the Top Ten debuting at No. 7. However, while Metallica and Megadeth toned down their music at this time, Anthrax were getting heavier. While previous vocalist Joey Belladonna had a higher voice that at times didn't gel with their heavier material, Bush's voice was stronger and rougher which gave them a heavier sound. His presence also put the band's flirtation with rap music to rest and as shown here they became a better band.Most of the tracks here are great and a few of them rank with their best work. The opening track &quot;Potter's Field&quot; is one of their most developed tracks, starting out with a slow grinding riff before gaining momentum during the choruses. The tracks &quot;Invisible&quot;, &quot;100 Points Of Hate&quot;, and &quot;Burst&quot; are among their heaviest songs and are highlighted by the monstrous drumming of Charlie Benante. The melodic &quot;Black Lodge&quot; is a great track featuring Bush's more understated vocals. The best tracks here are on the album's first half. &quot;Only&quot;, &quot;Room For One More&quot;, and especially &quot;Hy Pro Glo&quot; are all among their best work and are carried by Bush's mean vocals and Scott Ian and Dan Spitz's killer riffs. The remaining tracks &quot;Packaged Rebellion&quot; and &quot;This Is Not An Exit&quot; are also very good. This is certainly among their best work, probably their best next to Among The Living. It's certainly their best album with John Bush.

{"asin": "B0085CA8NY", "reviewText": "I was smitten with this game when I first played it, I loved the idea of zombies combined with the tropical scenery, especially from Banoi. But, after a while, it becomes evident that the weapon system was semi-ripped off from Borderlands, minus the fact that there are melee weapons that can break and be thrown, as well as grenades. Anyway, the game is slow at first and the side missions drag on, until you progress to a point where you fight other human enemies, instead of zombies, which introduce firearms and hand grenades into the gameplay. At about this point, NPC's actually start giving out decent weapon/cash rewards. If you can withstand the boredom of getting to this point, you're in for a short stretch of fun. However, there's no free roam after the story in this game so don't finish it until you're bored off your ass with running around, caving in skulls for achievements. After that, the only thing that profile's good for is is joining in a friend's game. If you like zombie games overall and have the patience to spend 2-3 hours walking all over an island infested with zombies and hoodlums, get this game.

When you think inductive, simply think of the charge that a Philips toothbrush uses. If your device is compatible, you can now call an end to that clutter. Of course you still have the AC charger and the micro USB cable to contend with, but you'll also be able to tuck those inside a drawer when not in use.I've seen one Qi charging device that is way too bulky for use. It went overboard trying to accommodate non-compatible devices with cables of all sorts dangling out the side. The iClever Qui-Enabled Wireless Charging Pad is clean, sleek, and far from bulky. Make sure you have a Qi-compliant device you want to charge or you'll have to get a case adapter if one is available at all.This is not a battery pack and doesn't have a USB port for charging an extra device. It's quite slim at .039\" thick and lightweight. Simply charge the Qi-Enabled pad overnight and you're ready to go. As soon as you put your Qi-Enabled device on the iClever it will begin to charge.

{"asin": "B0052TIRQI", "reviewText": "Installed it on my Sapphire Dirt 3 Edition HD6950 [...]There were two MAJOR problems.  First, the plastic stand offs are too long, even the shortest 3mm ones.  Glad I did a test fit because the copper bottom of the heatsink had at least a 1.5mm gap, not touching the GPU core at all!  So I had to trim the stand offs a little to get it to fit correctly.  So if you plan on using Artic Silver, you definitely need to check if it's touching the core or not, otherwise you can resort to using a thick TIM pad, but then what's the point of using an aftermarket cooler with such an inefficient heat transfer?Second, there is not enough space between the top of the heat sink fins to be able to fit the PCI-E power connectors.  And if you use a \"shorter\" HD6950 board like mine, the plastic shroud of the Accelero completely blocks it as well, I hastily trimmed the plastic to get it to fit, and bent the heatsink fins with plier to allow the PCI-E power connectors to fit.That said, my HD6950 went from idling at 55C to now idling at 46C.  In Furmark burn-in it tops out at 62C vs. 84C with the stock cooling.And the fans don't really spin any faster than idle.  So it's really really quiet.  I did crank the fans to 100% in Catalyst Control Center to see how loud it got.  Certainly louder, but a much nicer lower octave sound, more like a 5.25\" Optical drive spinning than the whiny hair drier-like sound of the fans in the stock one.  And overall much quieter even at 100%.So for cooling performance, I give it 5 Stars.For installation and fit, I give it 1 Star.I average it to 2 Stars since it was such a pain to install it.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Computer Components"], "core_classes": [["root", "Classical"], ["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Classical", "Compilations"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods"], ["root", "Classical", "Symphonies"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Renaissance (c.1450-1600)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Modern, 20th, & 21st Century"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Classical (c.1770-1830)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Romantic (c.1820-1910)"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

{"asin": "B00006JYMW", "reviewText": "I only know about Sigur ros from other amazon reviewers going completely crazy about this band from iceland. i've seen this album in countless listmania lists and on its own page, there are more than 200 reviews! gee what have i been missing here??? plus one of the reviewers mentioned that the booklet had only blank pages with NOTHING printed on them! i'm a designer so this intrigued me even more and when i saw the album at a local music store i literally jumped at it. now i'm expecting a lot from this band because i rarely buy something without any previous knowledge or hearing.after repeated listens (i listened to it for 5 times in one day and now it's been a week that i've been listening to it) i can say i'm so glad to have this album in my collection; right from the first track (all 8 cuts are untitled and have a total running time of 72 minutes), the sad and mellow tune freezes you to wherever you are. i personally closed my eyes  and didnt make a move, not wanting to spoil this moment, totally forgetting that this is a cd that i could replay for  as much as i wanted ! i'm glad noone witnessed my dumb trance when i listened to this. vocals are dreamy and blurry and i could hardly comprehend what the singer was saying; his voice seemed more like an instrument complementing the coherent whole of all other instruments. pianos produce simple minimalistic harmonies repeated and enhanced by keyboards that first are bearly heard but which gradually build up into walls of soaring majesty, magnificently blending with the pianos. the most amazing example of what i'm talking about is track 3 (my favorite); a recurring piano tune, so gripping that you never want to hear it end. i think these guys just showed us the meaning of the word &quot;cohesive&quot;. every remaining track goes on to unfurl into an 8-9 minute long mini-symphony that is simply delightful.this is not a happy album; some reviewers spoke of 'hope' .i could mostly sense the melancholy and sadness but only glimpses of hope, shimmering here and there, mostly through added background vocals.the last 2 tracks show a more proggish approach than in the beginning of the album where minimalism is most stricking and guitars were far less present; these last tracks remind me briefly of old pink floyd epics like &quot;shine on you crazy diamond&quot; or early marillion; i still havent decided if there is a weak track on this album because frankly they all seem to range from 'good' to 'jaw dropping' and i'm going to look for 'agaethis byrjun' which also seems to be another gem by these very talented artists. you owe it to yourself to check out this album if you're into plain, meaningful music you can feel in your inmost depths.", "categories":

Very poetic, some deeply sung as if from a smoky jazz club.This is music for people who grew up in the majority of the US, not a scrubbed-up suburb version or the down-and-dirty ghetto place.  There are elements of both those here, with a track like Taggin' and Braggin' obviously talking about committing small crime, in this case graffiti.However, most of the issues here are overtaken by the groove: buy this album for its flow.  Standout tracks include the aforementioned Taggin', the wonderful, true-to-its-roots \"DJ Saved My Life\" cover, the super-groovy title track, and a wonderfully-sampled The Reason.Some of the tracks are a little too serious in their poetry, but if you're into that, you'll love it  (namely, \"A Day in the Life,\" and \"E.R.A\").  Break out the beatnik berets and start a-snappin' your fingers.Overall, however, this album is all about a great groove, and it keeps it going on lots of nicely-crafted tracks.

{"asin": "B000UU7ZPS", "reviewText": "The Garmin 260 is a useful feature-rich GPS device without all those marginally useful features that do little more than jack-up the price.I have a friend who has a more expensive Garmin and I was impressed with what I saw while riding around with him in his vehicles.  GPS technology has really come of age over the last decade since I last owned a GPS device.This unit locks on to the the requisite number of satellites in short order and the maps are quite accurate.  One drawback is that sometimes the unit will direct you in some weird routes, but on the whole it will get you where you need to go when you don't have a clue yourself.  The main thing to remember is that you can't disconnect your brain when using it.Even when I'm just driving around town going places I'm familiar with, I like to have the unit on, because it tells me exactly where I am and lists the cross streets as I approach them.  Sometimes when I'm lost in my own thoughts, it's nice to just look at the device to determine exactly where I am on my route.The unit provides a wealth of information at a glance, including direction, speed, maximum speed, elapsed time (moving and not moving), estimated time of arrival, miles traveled, miles to go, coordinates, and elevation.  Of course, the turn-by-turn directions and the text-to-speech features are what this device and others like it are really known for.The points of interest feature is very useful I have found, not only while I'm driving, but for planning my errands.  It's like having a compact yellow pages. Of course, it's not comprehensive, but it is a good, quick resource.I bought this unit after spending hours on Amazon researching the various models.  I bought my unit at WalMart just as I was leaving for a long trip during which I was going to traverse Dallas/Fort Worth, which is one of the most challenging drives I've ever experienced.  Even though I was skeptical of the route offered by the device, it got me through the Dallas/Fort Worth maze of freeways better than I have ever done it before.  That alone made the unit worth the price.The Garmin 260 wasn't the exact unit I wanted, but it was the closest that WalMart had, so I went with it.  I could have saved a significant amount if I had planned my trip a little better and purchased my unit from Amazon in advance, but as I said, I feel I got my money's worth.I had wanted to get one of the wide units, but now that I have this one and realize that it is plenty legible and easily fits into the front pocket of my jeans, I'm more than pleased with it.I felt that the unit should have come with a USB connector, since in order to upgrade the unit and even to register the device, it must be connected to a computer.The instruction manual is the very model of minimalism, but being a gadget freak, I enjoyed teaching myself how to navigate the software.  Regardless, it is true that you can get this thing mounted and plugged in in short order and be on your way, even if you are only marginally competent in its use.I don't think that an AC adapter is necessary, although I might buy one later.  It runs fine plugged into one of the DC outlets in the car and it seems to me that it charged even while I was using it.  During my trip, power was never an issue.  I have a battery jumper that I plug the unit into at home, so I don't have to plug in while driving around town.I think that the Garmin 260 is a fine instrument for use while traveling or just puttering around town.  It has some quirks, but a sentient driver should have no problem dealing with them.  The 260 has just the features I like, without a bunch that I'd never use.The 2009 map upgrade was free of charge, by the way.It's a keeper, for sure.", "categories": ["Electronics", "GPS &

{"asin": "B000JGW9AO", "reviewText": "Another review said that the nicest thing they can say is that this game is better than Wii sports golf. I can't even say that. It has more depth that the Wii sports game, but generally is not as good.This game is loaded with features, though you would never know that when you start the game. You unlock EVERYTHING, of course that also means that when you start the game you have nothing. You start with ONE playable character. (Hey, at least start us out with like 2 people to pick from.) After a round you get points and with those points you can buy clothing, people, etc... The clothing system is great. Many items give your attributes an increase, so it can be a bit like an RPG where you have the gloves of +1 accuracy.Also, if you have enough Pangya (I have no idea if I am correctly using that phrase) you get to choose from special shots. However those shots are not as good as a normal shot.For some reason putting is extremely difficult. Not technically a knock on the game, but I can drive without any problems.The biggest problem with the game is its control system. It only half uses the Wii's motion sensing. You do a backswing & freeze. You then hit a button to lock in the speed of your shot. You can then swing at any speed and it goes at the predetermined speed. The (comparatively) shallow Wii sports has you swinging the way you would in the real world (i.e. the reason they got you to buy the Wii in the first place). If I wanted to hit a button when I wanted to swing I would look to the last-gen systems.This game does have far more courses than Wii Sports, but the control scheme is a sticking point. I can overlook the tough putting and other strange little things in the game, but if you are pushing a button to control your swing speed, instead of a full wind up and swing, then why bother with the Wii? Play some old Tiger Woods games if you are into that.", "categories": ["Video Games", "Kids & Family", "Wii"], "core_classes": [["root", "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"], ["root", "Sports Collectibles"], ["root", "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry", "A.Testoni"], ["root", "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry", "Orient"], ["root", "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry", "Aerosoles"]]}

Initially the Samsug Web Internet connection didn't work but after about 10 days I received an email from Samsung that the Web Internet had been fixed and I have verified that in fact it has and works well.  I attemped to use Amazon Prime as my home page and tried to view a video and it just continues to say loading and never does.  I have attached my laptop via HDMI to my Sony LCD and I am able to load quickly and view on the TV in full screen mode.  Samsung has told me they need to add the Amazon Prime App and whenever (if ever it is added) they will send me an email.  If I didn't have the Amazon Prime Problem that I described I would of given this device a five start rating.  Frustration is not what one expects when they purchase this device, in fact personally I would of considered another product that suppported Amazon Prime rather than having to play detective and having to find this out by having to waste my time and even call Samsung to find out that it didn't at this time support the Amazon Prime App.  I may consider Netflix in the future but I have a good cable triple pay price and don't need to cut the cable at this time.  I hope that this helps others who consider purchasing this product or those who may have purchased it and haven't tried to use Amazon Prime on it.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Blu-ray Players & Recorders"], "core_classes": [["root", "Amazon Instant Video"]]}

These Xylimelts seem to elicit the production of saliva for a longer period of time than the Biotene gel I tried.  Plus, they're much less expensive - and a good bargain is always welcome!  The directions say to apply two of the melts.  I tried two one night and then used only one on the second, as a result of another review.

I was looking for an alternative to rawhide for my German Shepard puppy. While he did love these treats a lot (hence 2 Stars) I was amazed at how quickly they vanished. It was literally about 5 seconds for him to eat one before he was staring up at me. Clearly not what I was looking for in a chew.I was able to partially salvage these treats by putting them into water and making blocks of ice/treat so they would last longer (although this can be messy).

{"asin": "B0024R4B5C", "reviewText": "I received as good or better signal from a pair of amplified VHF/UHF rabbit ears that I bought ten years ago. One channel (ABC) I can't get at all. The peculiar thing is that I am only 16 miles from the broadcast tower which is on top of a mountain that is 2000 feet above me in elevation. I have the antennae aimed directly at that mountain peak. Several stations come in superbly from the same mountain peak but this one channel reports as weak or no signal. A friend down the street whose view of the mountain peak is obstructed by a hill gets all channels with a pair of old RCA amplified rabbit ears. Go figure! Without amplification, however, he gets nothing at all and he did put the rabbit ears in the attic. If you have any question at all go for a bigger antennae than this. I would only get this one if you have space restrictions. I believe that is what this antennae is designed for--------people who cannot put up a larger antennae. I did mount the antennae outside 20 feet up in the air with no obstructions. For all I know ABC may broadcast a very weak signal which may never be an issue with other geographic locations in the country.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television"], "core_classes": [["root", "Electronics"], ["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Television Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "AV Receivers & Amplifiers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Aviation Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Car Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Compact Stereos"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Multiroom Digital Music Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Marine Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Satellite Dishes"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "LED TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "LCD TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "OLED TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Receivers & Amplifiers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "Plasma TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Tuners"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Aviation Electronics", "Aviation Handheld Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Audio & Video Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Aviation Electronics", "Aircraft Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Aviation Electronics", "Aviation GPS"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Installation Services"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Receivers & Amplifiers", "Component Amplifiers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Receivers & Amplifiers", "Component Preamplifiers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Satellite Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Center-Channel Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Amplifier Installation"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Subwoofers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Floorstanding Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Home Audio", "Stereo Components", "Speakers", "Soundbar Speakers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Amplifier Installation", "Power-Distribution Components"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Amplifier Installation", "Noise Filters"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Amplifier Installation", "Power & Ground Cable"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Amplifier Installation", "Interconnect Cables"], ["root", "Electronics", "Car & Vehicle Electronics", "Vehicle Electronics Accessories", "Vehicle Audio & Video Installation", "Speaker Installation", "Speaker Connectors"]]}
{"asin": "B00HHDF788", "reviewText": "I must say that when I heard of this wonderful book, I was seeking to find a way to have many things.More Time to spend with my family, More time with God, More time to help others and More time to Write, Read and Feel whole.  So what is a mom to do right ?  I prayed and spend time reading Bible, Reading books on parenting and how to have a great marriage.  While I still didn't feel like I had the answers and I surely didnt' feel like i had it all together.  Yes I know Mom's at age 50 should have it all together, but I don't.  I am not the perfect Wife, Not the perfect mom and I don't get time to go out and be with others alot of times.  We homeschool and that is hard for me, even  with 4 older ones who are out on their own now.  Yes I started homeschooling in 1990.  sorta gave up and let my oldest go to a baptist church school and then had more children and started again to homeschool them, well we made it through to teenage rebellion stage and they wanted to go to public school and given that we were a broken home, they went to live with their Dad for a time and did attend public school.  Most all of them came back home and eventually got their GED's and went on to college or to work and live life.  I am proud of each of them.~So here I am at age 50 and not feeling so balanced...smile~Along comes this new book on finding center in life as a work at home mom ! I thought at the time &#34; Wow, Lord this has got to be an answer to prayer &#34; , but Lord I have read so many books and not every thing works for everyone and Lord you have called me to do many things and I don't know where to start....  but I will give this book a try.  When I started reading Tricia's Book I could tell that the evil one was causing me a lot of tension, Kids went crazy that night, acting out and fighting, DH wasn't in a good mood and here I was just needing some sleep and yet this book was on my kindle and calling to me.  So at 10pm I started reading and didn't stop till 2 am, no I didnt' finish the book that night. I read, prayed, kept reading and prayed more. Talked to the Lord and  shed plenty of tears.  This book touched my heart !  It met me right where I was at and brought me full circle to stand as always right before the Lord.  Do I have it all together ? No, but what I do have is a desire to work harder to make it all work.  I know that God the Father sees me and knows my heart and my hearts desire. I know to that most women don't deal with some things I do.  He knows that I long to do so many things in life and yet I feel like for 50 years they have been put off for one reason or another , someone else's plans for life and living.  A year ago, I read a book that got me really excited about reading again.  It led to reading and reviewing christian authors books.  After a year and a half, it has led to me sharing about my life and all the things that the Lord has brought me through.  I have  for years had a desire to help girls going through teen pregnancy. I also have  a desire to help women who may have suffered rape, pregnancy, miscarriages , abusive relationships and divorce.  So Lord, How do I do that all from home and make it work ?  Well here came Tricia's book to show me that I wasn't alone and I could surely find my answers by seeking the Lord, following biblical teaching, loving my family and still occasionally having time to do something to help others.  And the best part is she reminded me I don't have to feel guilty about being me or about taking some time for myself to be who I truly am in the Lord.~ I know too that I don't have to feel ashamed of who I am ~I totally enjoyed this book and want to thank Tricia for being open, honest and such a blessing to women.  She is a wonderful Author, Sister in the Lord and a friend to so many.  She has encouraged me to seek God, Be myself, Share my heart and Love my life in Christ.I hope you will get a copy of this book and I hope you will find a mentor like Tricia or I and just seek the Lord and grow in Him.Until Next Time~Linda~", "categories": ["Books", "Parenting & Relationships", "Family Relationships"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root",

{"asin": "B008OEHPKM", "reviewText": "Although it's not obvious from the description, this mobile keyboard works with any operating system--Microsoft's Windows, Apple's iOS, or Android--so you can use it with any tablet, or even with a smartphone.  The only difference in functionality among them (and about the only thing about the keyboard I can ding) is that not all of the keyboard's hot keys work in iOS or in Android.  Neither the charm buttons nor the Windows icon key function in either non-Microsoft operating system.  However, the volume, mute, and pause/play buttons do.The keyboard is slightly smaller than other tablet keyboards  and it's light--about one pound--making it travel-friendly.  It requires three AAA batteries.  It feels sturdy; the base is metal, the keys are plastic, and it comes with a rubber cover that converts into a tablet stand that works very well.  When the cover is placed over the keyboard, the keyboard automatically turns off, so you don't have to worry about forgetting to hit a power switch and draining your batteries.Despite being small and light, the keyboard has a very good feel; the keys feel responsive.  There is no number pad, and the arrow and function keys are small, but all in all, it's a very good compromise between functionality and portability.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers &

{"asin": "B0013FLTNS", "reviewText": "In March 2008, I decided it was time to upgrade from a G4-based laptop to one of the new Intel models. I deliberated back and forth whether the lower priced MacBook would be sufficient or whether to pay the premium for the \"Pro\" model. Ultimately, I decided upon the MacBook Pro for these reasons.Construction qualityThe aluminum case of the MacBook Pro reminds me of a product made by the Swiss. The build quality is outstanding for a mass-produced device. It feels very substantial, and all the pieces fit together nearly seamlessly. The MacBook's case, however, is made from a high-grade plastic rather than metal. It's nice ... but I found the front edge of the MacBook's case a bit sharp on my wrists as I typed.PortsCompared with the MacBook, the MacBook Pro provides an additional USB port plus Firewire 800. The latter is desirable for people who work with video and external drives that have Firewire 800 connectors. The ExpressCard slot is useful for future expansion and services such as wireless broadband (EVDO).KeyboardKeyboard experiences are subjective; but I find the keyboard on the MacBook Pro the most comfortable of any laptop I've ever used. It feels solid and responsive. Plus, its backlighting is helpful when typing in dark environments.Dedicated videoUnlike the MacBook that shares system memory for video (integrated graphics), the MacBook Pro has a dedicated video processor. This is beneficial for driving large external displays and running graphics-intensive applications.Is the MacBook Pro worth the $700 price differential over a MacBook? That depends on whether you are a general home computer user (i.e., e-mail, web browsing, iTunes, word processing) or someone who uses their laptop for more advanced purposes. My user profile is more in the second category. Also, since I intend to keep this computer for three years, I figure that the premium breaks down to about $233 each year. This seems reasonable to me for something I use every day.In view of the additional quality and benefits that the MacBook Pro offers, I think its higher price brings with it commensurate value. It's hard to imagine even finicky laptop users being disappointed with the MacBook Pro.P.S. -- There are two 15-inch MacBook Pro models. I bought the 2.4 gHz \"entry level\" model. It is the better value. I do not feel the 2.5 gHz MacBook Pro is worth the extra $500.Also, people who care to add system memory (beyond the stock 2 gigabytes supplied by Apple) ought to purchase it from a third-party vendor and install it themselves.

{"asin": "B000SKXRGQ", "reviewText": "I bought this to help me keep straight which supplements and medications I've taken each day. I'm often away from home, and most of my gear goes in a backpack or messenger bag and it was quite inconvenient to carry a bunch of bottles around. I needed something to organize the pills by day that would not accidentally come open in transit, would not be bulky or awkward, and honestly I didn't want to use one of the boxy tupperware sort that might make me look like I belonged in an old folks' home or a convalescent ward.This is perfect. The design is sleek and low profile and is just a bit larger than a check book wallet. It features a tri-fold design with a velcro strap to hold it closed. The cover is a fairly durable slick black nylon weave.Inside it has 8 reusable ziploc pouches that are clearly labeled, and 8 labeled slots. The right-hand side has a place to insert emergency contact or medical information, or to put print-outs of your prescriptions/supplement labels (since you won't have the bottles with you).It takes up very little room in my bag, is inconspicuous and offers more features and functionality than I would have guessed.I have no regrets about spending a few extra dollars to get something like this. A great buy. Would purchase again.

{"asin": "B000038IFX", "reviewText": "And I put RPG's in quotes because its a joke to call someofthese games by that name. Xenogears is most likely the mostthought-provoking and deep RPG to ever hit a console. Good luckfinding it.STORY AND INSIGHT (NO SPOILERS): Created by the samemasterminds that created Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross, this gamewill have you question life and existance itself.  It masterfullyblends fantasy and reality to create startingly realistic settings ina fictional world. The game is out-of-print, however, so manyhard-core gamers searching for this rare gem are at the mercy of theauctioneers at Ebay. So why would such a game be out-of-print? Myguess would most likely be pressure from all sorts of religiouscommunities, especially Christianity. The core of the game ispresented around organized religion in general, and presents manyglaring corruptions that most likely exist in many organized religionstoday. While the fictional religion presented in Xenogears does bearsome striking resemblance to Christianity, there are also the samenumber of factors that set it apart, such as: there is no Christ init, and the preachers go around hunting evil creatures called&quot;reapers.&quot; However some similarities cannot be denied, but Iwill not touch upon them as they could be consideredspoilers...GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY: Enough about that, now about thegameplay. The controls are simple (as in any RPG) and its easy tonavigate due to the fully 3D environments. The battle system, whilenot the deepest, is probably the most fun I've had with an RPG sofar. For fighting by hand, you create fighting combos with thetriangle, X and square buttons. Kinda like Street Fighter meets FinalFantasy. There's also a second combat system involving robots named&quot;Gears.&quot; This one is a little more strategy involved, as themore powerful attacks you use, the more fuel you use. You don't evenget the necessary parts to heal your Gear until you're about 15 hoursinto it, thus adding more challenge.OVERALL: Its is a greatgame.... However, the story moves extremely slow at times. Trust mewhen I say that this only lasts for a few hours. Usually when thishappens, a major plot point will occur shortly after.

{"asin": "B000056TB2", "reviewText": "First of all, I bought the CD of WSS from BMG not sure if it was the Broadway or Movie cast since they didn't include the cast or a list of the tracks. I love the songs in this musical, from the camaraderie of Jet Song to the romantic Tonight, to the hilarious Gee, Officer Krupke, to the sad Finale. I have always compared the feeling of Tonight to We Kiss in the Shadows from The King and I. Still, however wonderfully these performers sound, I don't feel Chita Rivera's America can touch the vibrancy of Rita Moreno. I also preferred the way the guys and gals traded verses in the movie version of America, like when Bernardo's listing of unpleasant things in America was countered by Anita's \"You forget I'M in America!\" I never saw the play so I was puzzled at hearing I Feel Pretty so late on the disk, Gee, Officer Krupke sung after, not before, the rumble, and Cool sung before rather than after the same rumble. Good as the Broadway cast sounds, I still much prefer the movie soundtrack.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Broadway & Vocalists", "Musicals"], "core_classes": [["root", "Broadway & Vocalists"], ["root", "Broadway & Vocalists", "Musicals"], ["root", "Broadway & Vocalists", "Cabaret"]]}

{"asin": "B00IHR0H1K", "reviewText": "This is a pretty good, entry-level, hitch rack. It lacks the convenience features of its more expensive Hollywood brothers but it is still, a very strong and well-made rack.Assembly is not difficult, but for some reason the company included two extra parts that I didn&#8217;t see in the instructions, nor could I find any place to use them. Extra parts, like those you discover after rebuilding an engine, can be a bit disconcerting. The other issue was that one of the &#8220;safety screws&#8221; was stripped out so I used one that I had on hand. No worries, though. The screws are not truly necessary; they are more of a convenience. They keep the adjustment sliders from coming off the ends their poles when opening them to the bike(s). They do not secure the sliders to the bikes.This rack does not have a built-in lock but that&#8217;s no big deal. Most built-in locks can be overcome without tools by just applying sufficient force. If you want to lock your bikes to secure your multi-$1000 investment, remember two things: you need a good cable and padlock for short, unattended periods; and, your bike(s) will NOT be there when you get back if you leave them unattended for long periods (especially overnight), no matter what lock system you buy.The manufacturer&#8217;s description was accurate and this is a good rack for those who never need to get into their trunk/hatchback/tailgate. The only way to do so is to remove the bikes, and in some cases, the hitch itself as well. So, although I like this rack, I do not recommend it as highly as the Hollywood Sportrider2, which does what this rack does, plus it folds down out of the way to get into the back of your vehicle, and it does so for only about $20 more (at the time of this writing). Because this feature is pretty important to me, I downgraded the rating slightly.", "categories": ["Sports & Outdoors", "Accessories", "Car Sports Racks"], "core_classes": [["root", "Automotive"],

{"asin": "B000A0VOD2", "reviewText": "I'm not sure if it's supposed to be this way, but the Deer Off product I received was the consistency of buttermilk. The package was marked \"ready to use,\" so I know it's not meant to be diluted. I don't know what happened, but I do know sometimes stuff like this gets frozen in storage or sitting on a loading dock and changes consistency. Since I received it, it's been in my garage where the cold-hating cacti spent the winter.The sprayer was firing, but the repellent was too thick to make it through the gun and out. The sprayer seemed to have a lot of power when I sent water through it.If the sprayer worked with the Deer Off, this would be a great product.

{"asin": "B000M8YMEU", "reviewText": "Recently, I purchased a Rubbermaid spoon-shaped spatula to replace an old one (with a \"rubber\" blade) that had been in my kitchen drawer for more than 10 years.  Unfortunately, the new Rubbermaid spatula had a stiff blade (probably silicone) that didn't perform nearly as well as the old \"rubber\" blade.  The stiff new-model blade didn't conform easily to the sides of the bowl or pan that was being scraped, and it left behind a lot more ice cream, icing, sauce, and gravy than the old \"rubber\" blade.The blades of this wonderful set of silicone spatulas have exactly the same flexibility as the blade on my old \"rubber\" spatula.  All of them, but especially the spoon-shaped spatula, make it easy to scoop out thick mixtures quickly without leaving a lot of the mixture behind.  I am really pleased to have found this product, especially because the 3-piece set cost less than the single replacement (Rubbermaid FG193300WHT 9-1/2-Inch Spoon-Shaped Spatula).Other reviewers report that the spatulas are not durable, and that the blades come off, especially with dishwasher use.  However, for me the spatulas rate 5 stars, because what I need most are the flexible blades.  I use them for scraping bowls, not for mixing thick batters or for cooking on the stovetop.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Kitchen Utensils & Gadgets"], "core_classes": [["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Classical"], ["root", "Classical", "Compilations"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods"], ["root", "Classical", "Chamber Music"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Modern, 20th, & 21st Century"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Renaissance (c.1450-1600)"], ["root", "Classical", "Historical Periods", "Romantic (c.1820-1910)"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

However, I received a copy of John Black'sQuincy: 2116 in exchange for an review and truly enjoyed the tale. Initially, the book's sequence of jumping betweensettings of time and place put me off, but the story quickly ties everything together. The primary complaintsI have with most sci-fi are the over-whelming detail which bogs down the story and the two-dimensional charactersthat elicit no empathy from readers.  To his great credit, author John Black furnishes the vivid descriptive detailnecessary to picture the scenes but without burying the reader in a mountain of minutiae. In addition, the charactersdeveloped are engaging and unforgettable.  The only complaint I have about Quincy: 2116 is that the ending seemedsomewhat abrupt.  Of course, the reason might be that I was not ready to leave the characters that Black has created.Maybe John Black has made me a fan of science fiction after all.", "categories": ["Kindle Store", "Kindle eBooks", "Nonfiction"], "core_classes": [["root", "Computers"], ["root", "Alternative Rock"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "New Wave & Post-Punk"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Indie & Lo-Fi"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Hardcore & Punk"]]}

{"asin": "B00BXPHQF8", "reviewText": "The story gets off to a brutal start, when Katrine's husband leaves her for another woman. I was honestly prepared for a lot more of the initial aftermath than what I got, but I was grateful. The story picks up months later, with Katrine moving on with her life. This part of the story was pretty funny, and that's because of Katrine's friends and sister. This group of ladies was hysterical. I was always happy when they had a girls night, and would've loved more of their interactions.Part of Katrine moving on includes getting a job. That's where Xander Abbott comes into the story. This guy did not make a good first impression, for neither Katrine nor myself.  I would like to say that I warmed up to him, but that never really happened. I felt like he went from rude and arrogant to the man of any woman's dreams, and I just never became completely invested in him. Maybe that would have been different if I felt Xander had truly earned Katrine's affection. There is another man who is out to win Katrine, Ian, but those moments are so brief that I didn't he stood a real chance against Xander.I did enjoy Rebound. Katrine was a really sweet, likable main character. I did find her ramblings to be a bit melodramatic, to me, at certain points, but she was definitely entertaining. There were some nice steamy moments between her and Xander, and I think those who like their intimate scenes less explicit will definitely enjoy them.  I have to say that the ending of Rebound was unexpected and a little unsatisfying.  I really didn't see \"that\" coming! I like how Katrine handled herself, at least. I just felt things were unresolved, which sometimes is way more realistic, but still left me feeling antsy. I'm thinking that there will likely be a second book.Rebound was a sometimes funny, sometimes sad story of one woman's bumpy road on the road to life after divorce", "categories": ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Humor"], "core_classes": [["root", "All Beauty"], ["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

But she isn't the usual type one thinks of when envisioning someone at NSA - she is a computer geek.  Lexi is held at gunpoint, kidnapped, her apartment trashed, her privacy invaded despite new security, and then befriended by the person who asked Lexi's BFF to translate a document.  It all comes together with twists and turns, a chuckle or two, and lots of possibilities.

Honestly, after going thru the reviews and reading the description, I actually thought this would be a good read. The story had great potential. But what I found out was both the reviews and the description were misleading to the extreme! I actually had to force myself to read it all in hopes that it would get better and maybe, just maybe I was missing something. After I finished it, I was suprised to find that I was not wrong. Some parts left me with a 'huh' and others left me with a 'wait a minute' feeling, and at the end of the book I was left with a 'why did I read that' feeling. As I said, I think this particular story has great potential and is a good idea, but in turn as it is right now, I am a bit upset that the hype was all wrong.

{"asin": "B002MCZJ3C", "reviewText": "I've tried several competing network media players including the Asus O!Play, D-Link and Western Digital. And, frankly, they ALL have some serious issues, limitations or problems. Most of the problems center around the firmware. I'm not convinced these companies really have the expertise and desire to make media devices that work correctly. These players represent only a tiny fraction of their total business and it shows. If Asus computers, D-Link routers or WD hard drives were as buggy as their players are, they'd be out of business.Since I purchased this player two months ago, Asus has already had 3 firmware updates for it. With each update they fixed some things but created many more new problems. For example, the original firmware played flash video, but the later versions don't.One thing, despite lots of complaints, they've yet to fix is the awkward menu to play media off a NAS, server, or PC. It can be a dozen or more button presses on the remote to navigate your home network, shares and file structure. And if there are any media files scattered along the way, the O!Play sometimes tries to preview them even when you're just trying to move to the next directory. This seriously slows things down. It's incredibly frustrating and unfriendly.Worse, the player offers something of a \"shortcut\" or \"favorites\" feature that easily COULD be used to set up the path to your favorite files. But they don't give you any way to do that! Linux hackers used to be able to set up their own paths, but Asus has managed to break even that with the last few firmware releases.And worse still, although it's happening less with the latest firmware, the player sometimes just locks up or reboots itself. You go to watch a movie, and if it doesn't like the format, you get a black screen for several seconds then you're dumped all the way back out at the opening menu because it just crashed and rebooted. So you get to go through the above dozen button pushes all over again. And again. And...I've tried to use the O!Play with PlayOn and Tversity and that's when it locks up/reboots most often. It just doesn't like dealing with some of the transcoded streaming video from either one.Asus has added a \"Live\" feature with a bunch of internet video sources. Beware, however, many are duplicates, and a large number are Asian (as in non-English). Asus is in Taiwan and it's really clear the firmware for the O!Play was developed in Taiwan. Frankly, Asus should stick to computers.I think the hardware is fine. And if you just want to watch movies in normal formats off a USB stick, the O!Play works reasonably well. But if you try to do much more, you're going to run into firmware problems.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Streaming Media Players"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"],

{"asin": "B00D3XWOUK", "reviewText": "This was a pretty good book. By that I mean it kept me entertained even when it felt like it was taking me extra long to read it. .  I did not realize this book was as long as it is because I read it on my Kindle.  I would have made two good books, but it made a fine book altogether. I don't think I missed out on anything by it being one book in itself. To me, it just meant I had more content to explore.There were plenty of great elements in this story. There was a good storyline, the characters were well defined, and the world in which they live was easy for me to imagine. There was love, deceit, conflict and despair and just so many different emotions flying all over the place that you could almost see the looks on the characters faces in each scene. I can't say I remember reading anything recently that made me so angry at the characters who were acting like jerks or who were lying. I wanted everyone to work things out and learn to work together. I just wanted to yell at them all, \"Why can't you guys just see that you need each other to survive!\" It made me so angry that Elite were so greedy and mean with the Amiti, who were there to help them but were rewarded with slavery in so many cases. I felt genuine sympathy and anger with these characters, which is not something I can honestly say happens to me to such a real degree.I enjoyed the historical elements to this book as well. I love love love Egyptian legends and stories. I've always wanted to study Egyptian archaeology, so having so much Egyptology based elements was awesome to me. It gave me more to the story that I could connect to because in some ways it felt familiar.The storyline is pretty easy to follow if you pay attention. It is well planned out and will keep you attention. She introduces the characters in a way that is thorough and well placed. She gives you enough back-story for each character throughout the book that you understand the characters and their flaws, but continue to learn about them during the entire book. She has given her vampire story a unique spin that is quite refreshing to read after such a huge boost in vampire books over recent years.This was this first installment to her Vampire Elite Series. I really look forward to reading the rest of the series, especially if the rest are as well done as this one. I'm very interested to see where else she is going to take these characters.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a different kind of Vampire book that doesn't fall into the typical Paranormal Romance category. There is an array of emotions expressed throughout the book, so be prepared to feel something. It does not give you the usual warm fuzzies that many paranormal romances will give you.", "categories": ["Books", "Literature & Fiction", "Genre Fiction"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"],

{"asin": "B000G1ME8E", "reviewText": "We purchased several of these two years ago and really appreciate the assurance they provide.  They are LOUD and easy to install and no false alarms.  We have them in the basement by the sump pump and by the water main (which has leaked before during heavy rains) and in the wet bar.  They are easy to install using Velcro and have a 12-18\" pigtail that is sturdy but can be bent over the edge of say a sump pump.  Batteries last a year plus and do beep when they get low.  This model is bit more money than others but we haven't had any of troubles others have reported on those.  We don't go in our basement a lot so the peace of mind knowing we'll have an alarm if trouble develops is great. Several friends have had their sump pump fail and got flooded while they were in house.  Of course, if you are not home this won't help and you'd need a more fancy whole-house shut-off system like WaterCop, but that is LOTS of $$.", "categories": ["Tools & Home Improvement", "Rough Plumbing", "Pipes, Pipe Fittings & Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Classical", "Compilations"], ["root", "Classical", "Chamber Music"], ["root", "Classical", "Symphonies"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

Gee, Vedder and Bon Jovi are making a killing at it so why dont I do it?  It is not the message I disagree with it is when a musician who has been so artistic and different regresses back into the depths of simpledom and joins the mighty minions who, in their own mind, think they know something.  It amazes me, it so amazes me how someone who knows nothing of war or politics can sit there and spew for hours and feel like people are going to believe them.  Someone said once of aspiring authors \"write what you know\" and I think this needs to apply to musicians as well.  Nothing cool about this CD, just a lot of nonsensical noise that has no purpose.  There is no feeling.  There is no emotion.  There is no direction.  There is no variance or evocation of intelligence.  Rezzy just made something he knew would sell.  There was a day when a concept style album like this had some meat to it, but there is not a strand of meat here, just post spice girls glam.  year zero is named true because this album is worth nothing.  I gave mine to the neighbor kid, he looked pleased, of course he does not know any better, but I be he knows more than Trent.

{"asin": "B008FC8FPC", "reviewText": "I got this for a gift for my Mom and she loves it!  She has it on her desk at work and it works perfectly.  I really wanted something that could be setup and forgot about and this is it.  I got an 8GB Class 10 SD card for it (so it would have fast performance and 8GB was more than enough for her photos).  The unit has an easy to understand menu and a coin battery for keeping the time and date information after it is set.  You have great options for fine tuning this to how you want it.  For example, we have this set to come on and off automatically 7:30 am to 4:00 pm Monday through Friday, I love the fact that you can set it for just weekdays.  The frame has a nice resolution and photos look great on it. I did do a batch conversion and shrunk all the photos from there original resolution to a resolution of around 1000px wide (for faster loading and to make them look better on this display).  The unit also supports random photo order which is nice (so she does not see the same grouping of photos) and has an option to turn off the calendar overlay on the photos (this can be set so it automatically starts the image slideshow in a random mode and hides the calendar).  Essentially this device allows her to have all of her favorite photos on her desk in one sleek photo frame without having to ever touch it.  The frame is super thin (top is thinner than an iPad and the bottom has a stand that sticks out and that is where the power and SD card go in).  The frame also has a light sensor on the front that allows for auto dimming and brightness of the display for the room that it is in.In the end this is a perfect item for my Mom, she can have all her photos on her desk and never have to deal with the unit.  She seems to love this device and seems really happy seeing all of her photos.  The unit also looks techy and formal on her desk and meets the decor look of her computer monitors and everything.

{"asin": "B0027CS7BI", "reviewText": "my DS loves musical rhymes. he got a fisher price learning puppy as gift when he was a month old and still in love with it 7 months later. the giggle belly dvd is also a hit. naturally i thought this book would become one of his favorites as it has seven different rhymes. my mistake. not a single song is complete and i don't understand why. do they expect an infant to read from the book and sing along the music? which age group exactly they are making this book for? the look and feel of this book is perfect for a baby but i don't think would be appealing to the toddlers who can actually sing to the music (reading the rhymes still in question).the moment my son starts enjoying a rhyme it's stopped (only the music continues). plus when a song is running and baby hits (babies do that all the time) one of those animal heads, they will start making their own sounds or songs. so my ds lost interest in this book within a day of its arrival. the only time he shows excitement is when i sing along and finish the song. problem in that part too...making the book to play a particular rhyme or music is almost impossible even if you are on a particular page. i am highly disappointed with my purchase. wish i read the negative reviews more carefully or could learn from my past experience.i noticed a couple of problems with vtech musical toys (unfortunately i own two):1) the voice is pretty annoying and monotonous2) a lot of unnecessary sounds (doesn't work for my baby atleast)still giving 2 stars because of the look and feel.for me NO MORE Vtech. do not buy this product if you are looking for melodious rhymes. add 2-3 buks more and get a fisher price book. i am sure you will never regret the investment and your li'l one will actually enjoy.",

{"asin": "B002O3W3Y2", "reviewText": "I did a lot of reading before purchasing an iPod dock and this had some of the most favorable reviews of the many I investigated. Having owned the unit now for a few weeks I can say I am very pleased with the product.THE SOUND: The term \"audiophile\" is thrown around alot in these reviews, but when it comes down to it I think most of us can hear the difference between good and bad sound. The Klipsch has incredible sound. Strong, rich bass (the biggest plus for my ears), excellent highs and mids, and good amplification that can easily fill a big room without sounding like you're stressing the unit. I give its \"sound\" 5/5 stars.THE BUTTONS: It's a very simple device, and it seems like the lab put all its efforts into making kick-ass sound, but not much else. It has a power button, and a volume up and down button. That's it. Kinda artistic in its minimalism.DOCKING: They were kind enough to include a plethora of docking inserts to accommodate any type of 30 pin device you may own. I found that with my iPod classic in its case, however, the docking insert prohibited its attachment. The same went for my iPhone 4S. No matter, it docks just fine without these inserts.FUNCTIONALITY: The only thing that could have made it better is more functionality, or a LED display or something. Basically, this unit is ONLY for listening. You could perhaps set it up to be an alarm clock, but only using the alarm clock function on your device. No radio, no CD player, no equalizer, no clock, nothing.INPUTS: Thankfully it has a minijack input, so you can attach other devices that don't have the iPhone 30 pin attachment. It also has an S-Video input. I'm quite sure I've never used this type of input, ever.REMOTE: Also minimalistic in its functionality: play/pause, volume +/-, track fwd/bkwd and mute. You cannot \"control\" your device, bring up your menu so you can scroll through your library, or adjust sound settings (eg no \"bass boost\" button) and the like. Again, its obvious they put their time and effort into sound, not bells and whistles.Despite these limitations this is still an excellent unit and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a simple device with excellent sound to enhance the atmosphere of your living space, your parties, etc. If you want an all in one unit to wake you up, cook your breakfast, serve your friends tea and feed your pet, look elsewhere.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books",

The old 23\" Samsung LCD TV this replaced had an analog audio loop that output whichever source you had picked, HDMI, broadcast, etc. My 32\" Samsung has an analog and an optical audio out. Even my cheap Samsung computer monitor has an audio out. My surprise was to find out that this monitor has no provisions to hook up your own sound system. I managed to set my self up with an RCA analog switcher, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014KOAD8/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details, to get the audio from my BluRay and the cable box to the external speakers but it means that for now I can't use the TV remote to switch the audio or control the BluRay sound.

{"asin": "B0088CJT4U", "reviewText": "The benefits of this router are probably standard benefits of 802.11AC - faster speeds, longer range. I have a more expensive router in the office, and from connectivity perspective I don't see any difference.Two positives that stand out:* Like many people, I have a modem with built-in router that I can't turn off (thanks, Uverse :( ). So, I wanted to run this as wireless access point and a wired switch. There is a knowledge-base article and it turned out to be astonishingly trivial.* I opened a ticket on my guest network problem (below), and had several email exchanges with support tech. I found it very unusual that he understood my question, and answered very specifically and with relevant information. Oh, and he didn't ask what Operating system I am running ;)A few complaints.* Using the router as print server requires installing a TP-Link client (from CD) on every computer. That's so 90s! Not to mention that one of my machines doesn't have CD Drive, and another has it vertically, so mini CD keeps falling. Handling USB drive, on the other hand, is quite trivial.* With the router in Access Point mode I can't run Guest network unless I \"allow guest network clients to access my LAN\"... which kind of defeats the purpose of guest network in the first place! It may be a limitation of Guest network design in general; and not specific to this router* Advanced administration pages are very confusing. I realize, they are trying to make it easier for non-techies, but in the end it's just more incoherent. Specifically, NAT pages and Access control. Also, strangely missing are QoS pages (or maybe I just couldn't find them).* Compared with other brands, three sticking antennae look ugly. WAF may be significantly affected!In summary, it seems to be a great entry level AC router. I didn't see any compromises on core functionality (speed or range), but some secondary aspects are not as good as competition.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Routers"],

{"asin": "B0015Z1LY8", "reviewText": "After reading and verifying reports of \"another brand\" having a problem with worms being found in their larger packages, we decided to give these a try (even though we personally never had a problem with finding any worms in other chews it just didn't make sense to keep purchasing the \"other brand\" and possibly risk our dog's health)The package is clean and crisp and the chew aroma is, in fact, closer to what you'd expect from a fresh dog food product.I honestly don't think the brand matters one way or another to our dog since she could and would eat an entire package in one sitting if allowed but, there is a noticeable difference; in moderation Nutri-Dent seems like a better product.I bought the small ones off-line while waiting for these and she does like the small ones better, which are little bigger and take a little longer to finish one, but the minis are a safer size for dogs under 5lbs.. No digestion problems with either, which I was concerned about with these.Until reviews for the \"other brand\" improve, these are worth the slight price difference but, only on Amazon. (These are way, way, way too expensive off-line!)We use these as special rewards but, I don't recommend these as a substitute for brushing in between vet dental cleanings.Kudos to Amazon for keeping the costs down so us dog parents can afford to keep their teeth clean so they can chew these and their foods without being in pain!(all of these types of chews are excellent ways to get your dog used to brushing if used as an \"after brushing\" reward so the amount per/bag is ideal per month, too!)", "categories": ["Pet Supplies", "Dogs", "Treats"], "core_classes": [["root", "Pet Supplies"],

{"asin": "B000VI70WC", "reviewText": "This is a great addition to the very small Seether catalog, and a wonderful piece of music that'll enhance anyone's harder edged music collection. Since most people that I know are really narrow minded when it comes to Hard Rock or Metal, this may be a great album to play in these people presence, as kind of a, \"Whoops, how did this get on?\" And see if they'll like it. It's very catchy and every song is very listenable. I was fortunate enough to buy the disc before Careless Whisper was included. The first time I heard this added song on Sirus' Octane, I couldn't stand it, and it never did grow on me. Luckily, it's not a bonus song that I'd have to go out and buy, just to make my collection complete. I don't even want the song on my MP3 player.I'm not giving 4 stars for the inclusion of Careless Whisper, I'm giving it because of the Seether rip-off tactics that they've used over the span of their career. I know that the record companies push to promote and to make money, which is the reason they are in business anyway, but I'm so tired of having to have to buy a CD all over again to get the extra-song or the expanded edition or the acoustic version. This has happened with other bands too. Just check out Flyleaf and Blue October for a few examples. Seems like the late comers always get the bonuses and the fans just get pinched for more money.

The Monster High ghouls always have great detail and this doll includes some fun Abbey accents.  She has a little bit of fur trim on the bottom of her dress which is pink and purple with a spiderweb and ice crystal pattern.  For accessories, Abbey has a translucent icicle belt that matches her purse, and purple ice crystal earrings and necklace.  I have other Abbey dolls wearing boots, but her shoes in this basic Scaris addition are my favorite footwear for her - they are pearl white with stacked glacier heels.Like the other basic dolls in the new Monster High Scaris line, this doll does not come with a stand, which is a little frustrating.

{"asin": "B005DKKBP6", "reviewText": "The Panasonic electric shaver is by far the most expensive shaver I, or my husband, have ever used!My husband has a Panasonic (similar to this model but with fewer blades) and a Norelco with the three, round, floating heads. After using this Panasonic, he says that he thinks the Norelco gives the closest dry shave, but this Panasonic gives the best wet shave he has ever had and that it is as smooth and close as a regular razor. I use it on my underarms, wet and dry, and it is definitely the best electric shaver I have ever used. CAUTION: The users manual says not to share this shaver with others for sanitary reasons and I would never share it with anyone but my husband of almost 40 years. Even then, I clean it carefully after each use.This is a foil-style electric shaver. There is a huge difference between rotary style shavers and foil style shavers and how you shave with them. The user manual says that it takes a month to get used to a new shaver and when I first read that, I thought it sounded crazy. It's not. Particularly if you are accustomed to using a regular razor or a rotary style shaver. My husband felt this shaver didn't give as close a shave initially compared to his old shaver, but now after two weeks, he feels he gets an exceptional shave with it. I would caution anyone considering this shaver to understand that you may not be happy with your shave at first and to realize that any new shaver requires a commitment of daily use for at least a couple of weeks before deciding if you are pleased with it.The shaving head is quite large and pivots in two directions, however you can lock the head so that it is stationary. My husband has found that locking the head is very helpful for shaving under the chin and neck. It is fairly loud, but not unpleasantly so. The handle is extremely comfortable. There is a pop-up trimmer that works fine - nothing special but does the job. There is a digital read-out on the handle which tells you how long each shave takes and how much battery life is left. (I thought the timer for how long your shave lasted was silly, but my husband and sons think it's cool.)The recharging/cleaning dock is one of the features that make this an exceptional shaving system. It will take up some real estate on your counter. It measures 3 3/4\"W x 5 1/4\"D x 7 3/4\"T with the shaver in the charging position. But it will charge, clean and dry your shaver for you with just the touch of a button. The shaver is held head down in the charging/cleaning/drying position via magnetic contacts. It takes about an hour to fully charge this shaver. Note: you can also plug the power cord directly into the bottom of the shaver, which is good for traveling because the cleaning station would be bulky and messy to transport.The head sits in a well that fills with cleaning solution when you initiate the cleaning process. The cleaning process automatically sets the shaver to sonic cleaning mode several times while it is cleaning. When cleaning is complete, a fan dries your shaver with heated air. Drying is important in my experience with foil shavers because it extends the life of the foils. The solid cleaning solution is in a small cartridge that you slide into the bottom of the cleaning station. It should last about 6 months. The back of the cleaning station has a slide out reservoir that you fill with water used to dissolve the cleaning solution.You can also clean this shaver by applying liquid soap to the foils and then setting your shaver to sonic cleaning mode. It produces a lot of foam and then you can remove the foil head and rinse the shaver clean. The emphasis on cleaning is important because regular cleaning keeps the blades sharp longer, prolongs the life of the foils, provides a closer and more comfortable shave, and is more sanitary to avoid minor skin infections. Cleanliness really IS next to godliness when it comes to shaving.Also included is a custom fitted, zippered travel pouch and a snap-on plastic foil head protector.Clearly this razor is a premium product at a premium price. Is it worth it? I would say that it depends upon whether or not it is comfortably within your budget. You will get a fine shave and the cleaning/charging station makes the whole process completely effortless, but the price seems a little high to me based upon other shavers with similar features.",

The title track is the only one worthy of a listen, as the rest are outdated hippy garbage. The title track contains an interesting and very creative main riff. However, to carry this basic riff for 17+ minutes is ridiculous. Several complaints: a) Main riff is good, but more suited to a 3 min. single, b) musicianship is not that great, c) Guitar solos are uninspired, simplistic, and quite annoying, d) Sound quality is poor, tinny, and annoying, e) drum solo is to simplistic, poorly recorded, and obviously didn't require much talent, and f) the lyrics, which are sparse, are repetitive, boring, and don't stimulate the imagination as psychelic music should. Overall, I consider this album to be quite poor, and even on acid, would'nt find it very interesting. Try some Pink Floyd if you want a good, honest to God, psychedelic trip.

Didn't get the holder stand as in the picture for this but instead received the flexi-stand like the other 200x microscopes for sale here at Amazon.  Flexi-stand would work well for pics of stamps, coins, other flat articles that are flat and are not suspended like a plant.  I'm going to need a gooseneck like stand to hold the microscope steady.Colors are true, at least for greens, browns, clears/translucents and yellows.  That's all I dealt with.20x and 400x fixed focus only....There is NO zoom here.  Focus is at either extreme end of the focusing travel of the focusing knob.  A little free play allows fine focusing at either 20x or 400x.  Both magnifications are only approximations from a crudely calibrated and marked focus knob.There are 6 LEDs that light up the items with strong naturally looking white light that is also adjustable from full-on to full-off and anywhere between.  The light strength adjustment knob barely extends out from the body and is somewhat a pain to dial in.COMPLAINTS:  Focus knob really difficult to use while trying not to move or shake it much.  Same goes with the LED light level adjustment.Software easy to load, works as advertised (but NOT zoom) and seems solid enough.

{"asin": "B00667F7OK", "reviewText": "As others have already stated, this is a dynamic driver design and not a planar magnetic (\"orthodynamic\") headphone like Hifiman's other models.Based on the model number and price being the lowest of the Hifiman family, you'd instantly think \"entry level\" model.  But that's perhaps not an accurate way to look at it.  Think of it more as an alternative with a little bit different flavor of sound.This is a \"warm\" and smooth headphone.  It's not going to be the most detailed or accurate headphone around, but it goes for a fun and engaging sound signature, with solid bass and mids, and smooth and somewhat docile highs.This headphone works very well with trance, classic rock, and especially jazz, though in general it will do most all genres fairly well.Soundstage is not really that great.  It sounds very intimate and close, think \"jazz club\".Construction and build is very sturdy.  The shell is the same as the other Hifiman cans in its design, but this headphone is much lighter than the ortho models, as planar magnetic designs add quite a bit of weight.It's also quite easy to drive from portable and PC.One issue is that the silver plated and braided cable that comes with the newer revision, while providing excellent sound quality, is VERY stiff and very microphonic, and also quite long.These used to be $300, which I thought was an okay price, but they've since been reduced to 250 where I think they are a much better bargain when compared to the competition, which is fierce in this price bracket.  I personally would look for a lightly used pair at around 170-200.  With the orthodynamic HE-400s at 299 (which I have right now), paying 250 for these might be harder to justify as the 400s are definitely a couple notches above these in sound quality.If you're a jazz fan or like a warm, smooth, and laid back listen, these are definitely worth considering.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Alternative Rock"], ["root", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "American Alternative"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Compilations"], ["root", "Alternative Rock", "Indie & Lo-Fi"]]}

{"asin": "B004XVSXJM", "reviewText": "It's July 2010 and as Paradise Found opens readers find themselves visiting the beautiful, peaceful island of Anguilla. Mark and Cameron have been in a committed relationship for two years and their sex life has been waning for some time so they have taken a vacation to the island, to try and reconnect and are on the lookout for a man who they are both attracted to and may be agreeable to a threesome. The idea is that a wild night of pleasure may assist to infuse some much needed spice into their intimate life.Philip is on a post college vacation in Anguilla and is trying to shore up his fortitude before returning to Boston and entering into the family law firm. He is extremely morose about fulfilling his family's expectations as it requires him to suppress his sexual identity. In fact, his father considers homosexuality to be a deviation. Then along comes Mark and Cameron who are both attracted to Philip from the moment they spot him and after introductions, some banter and a few drinks, the invitation to engage in a night of carnal pleasure is presented.What happens during their hot erotic encounter (the love scenes in this novella are sexually explicit) leaves all three men reeling. Mark learns things about his lover's sexual preferences that he previously was completely unaware of. Philip is a natural submissive, Cameron is a dominant and has suppressed this predisposition for a long time. Cameron is a man with deep secrets which he has kept from Mark because of shame and fear of hurting his lover. When making love to Philip, however Cameron's dominant tendencies come rocketing to the surface.The morning after their night of passion proves extremely difficult for all three men. Philip sees a bleak future ahead having to play the roll of a heterosexual to please his family and not bring `shame' to the law firm. He too has learned things about his sexual needs during the encounter with Cameron and Mark which makes his return to Boston even less palatable. In addition, he has developed strong feelings for the couple. How could he not? However, Philip does what is expected of him, represses his sexuality and leaves the island to meet his fate.As for Cameron and Mark? Instead of improving the intimacy in their lives the m&eacute;nage causes a communication rift the size of the Grand Canyon and I questioned how they were going to repair the damage and reconnect. In addition, Cameron is struggling with guilt over what happened with a previous lover and the needs that the m&eacute;nage experience with Philip and Mark rekindled in him. Mark also struggles with his own set of issues related to his role in the threesome, needs it awakened and fear of losing Cameron.What I really liked about this story was Ms. Raines' characterization of Philip. A brilliant attorney, Philip comes alive in front of a jury, proving himself a valuable asset to the family's law firm. Further he finds a calling in volunteer work, helping people in need of legal assistance at a local shelter. In essence, Ms. Raines matures and strengthens this character over the course of the story. However, his lack of personal happiness is palpable and I was so relieved when Philip finally takes matters in hand and makes plans to see Mark and Cameron again. I cheered when he stands up to his bigoted Neanderthal of a father. When the three men do meet again after a year it is Philip who is the catalyst and mediator in helping them to work through some very complex relationship issues.I found Paradise Found to be a moving contemporary m/m/m story that tugged at my heartstrings more then once. Ms. Raines touches on a number of themes and there are BDSM elements. My one niggle was Mark. I struggled somewhat with his role in the threesome and didn't quite see how he fit in especially given a scene at the end of the story that was bothersome for me. However, I felt Paradise Found was an extremely well plotted story heartfelt story and I liked Cameron, Mark and Philip very much.3.5/5 stars", "categories": ["Books", "Gay & Lesbian", "Literature &

If you  don't mind wearing larger headphones, and caring around a ten foot cord (which can be neatly tied up) you are going to get much better sound than with any sony, or Panasonic headphones out there.I liked them and so did my son, so I just ordered an extra pair for his IPOD NANO. It's a huge improvment over the stock IPOD ear buds Apple offers. Not to worry about HD-212 Headphones not supplying enough power from an IPOD, it's more than enough. So much so that it blocks out 80-90% of normal exterior sounds.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Computers & Accessories", "Cables & Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Rock", "Progressive"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Folk", "Traditional Folk"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Folk", "Traditional British & Celtic Folk"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Rock", "Country Rock"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Miscellaneous", "Poetry, Spoken Word & Interviews"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Rock", "Rap Rock"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Rock", "Funk Rock"], ["root", "Digital Music", "Miscellaneous", "Wedding Music"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Tennessee"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography", "United States", "Michigan", "Carleton"]]}

{"asin": "B003F77AO4", "reviewText": "This is the second book I've read by Ms. Faulkner and I like her writing style, its no holds bar and unapologetic, she gives you an unfiltered look at the BDSM lifestyle. I have read many BDSM themed books and one of the things that I find in common with many of the stories is that BDSM is romanticized before the Hero and Heroine even get into any type of physical relationship; I'm not complaining because I can appreciate it and I like that angle. However, In the story of Faith and Cordero aka El Diablo there was no pretense of love or even liking between these two, it was very raw and not for the faint hearted. If your looking for something pretty and flowery with a little BDSM thrown in to spice it up for you than this is definitely not the book for you. At times Cordero's attitude towards Faith can be gritty and very brutal at times. And some of the things that he does to her are non-consensual, but in defense of the story's plot Cordero is Faith's kidnapper and is not at all inclined to be kind to her, when his whole goal in kidnapping her was to punish her for something her \"father\" did.This story is pretty heavy on the Sado-Masochism side of BDSM, Cordero is big on the pain aspect he can inflict on his partners in order to reach pleasure for them both. I'm not criticizing this aspect but I am warning those who may decide to read this story, and if you are as interested in BDSM as I am and have read other literature outside of fictional stories you will see what the mental and emotional mind set of both Cordero and Faith is as the story develops. And either you can appreciate it or not.Overall I enjoyed the story because it was so \"in your face\" there were certain things that bothered me but not enough to make me stop reading it. The ending of the story wasn't your typical HEA it left a lot of unanswered questions, well at least for me.

{"asin": "B000RZDBM2", "reviewText": "I have two TiVo boxes: a series 2 and this one. The series 2 box is analog, and I worry it might not work after the switch to digital. This one I know will work, however, because I have my TiVo connected to two antennas--and not a cable or satellite box--I'm not sure if I'll be able to record two channels at once come February.So the great things about this TiVo box are:1. Record all the shows you want automatically and watch them whenever you want. With just two clicks on the remote you call tell your TiVo that you like Ugly Betty, for example, and that you want it to record Ugly Betty whenever it goes on. No more will your schedule revolve around the TV schedule. You watch the shows you want to watch whenever you want to watch them.2. It temporarily records whatever show you're watching, so you can have an instant replay whenever you want, or you can pause to answer the phone or whatever. No more scheduling breaks around commercials. You can break whenever you want, and you can zoom past those commercials.3. You can type in keywords that interest you and set the box to just look for programs with those keywords or even automatically record them. For example, if you like Robin Williams, you can have your TiVo automatically record Robin Williams movies or just let you know when they'll be on.4. There are a lot of extras, like music videos, music, special videos, weather forcasts, games and lots more.5. If you have a Netflix subscription, you can watch movies in your \"Watch Instantly\" queue on your TV through your TiVo box. Unfortunately, I've found some movies stream better than others, with the sound coming much later than the picture. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.6. You can also purchase or rent Amazon Unboxed movies to watch through your TiVo on your TV.Aside from the streaming problem mentioned above, we have run into problems with our TiVo box from time to time. There have been times when the machine just got stuck when we selected to see a Netflix movie, and there have been other times we've had to reboot. Some things can take a long time, like exiting your Season Pass Manager after making changes. And there was a time the TiVo box wasn't recording anything because there were too many things in our Season Pass Manager. (It turned out my daughter entered the same program at the same time on four different channels, which is probably what caused the problem).Yes, it's not perfect, but one of the great things about TiVo is the company is constantly updating the software. Old problems are fixed, and new features are added.

My netbook's battery sticks out a bit so I was a little worried it might not fit, but it fits beautifully.But how hard is it to mess up a zippered sleeve to begin with?  Well here's what makes this a great sleeve:1. The zipper's open/close placement is very ideal for easy insertion into the sleeve.  Some sleeves or cases that have two zippers or zippers that zip exactly half-way around aren't ideal because the sleeve flops open and makes it cumbersome to insert your netbook, zip up and go.  This Caselogic sleeve zips open and closes diagonal from the fully open and fully closed end.  This means you can easily grasp the sleeve with one hand and throw your netbook in and go.2. With the zipper placement diagonal, to zip it up, the weight of the netbook allows you to zip up your sleeve with just one hand.  Think about zipping a sleeve/case that has 2 zippers with one hand.  Yes, I'm an engineer and I tend to focus on obscure design details!3. The exterior is a good neutral (herringbone) color and the entire sleeve is padded and soft/spongy neoprene.

{"asin": "B002BRZ9G0", "reviewText": "There's been a lot of taking turns and character swapping with the Super Mario Bros. games over the years, but it seems strange that a series about two brothers has never really put them on the same screen before. In other genres, the name Mario is synonymous with multiplayer thrills, but in the official platforming games, Luigi, Toad and anyone else in the headlining plumber's crew are usually sidelined. But with New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Miyamoto decided that this year's big innovation would be four-player support, ushering in a fresh, chaotic, friendship-ending brand of fun to the beloved series.This is not to say that the game fails to offer a compelling solitary experience. While playing alone can't offer anything as thrilling as tossing your buddy into a swarm of enemies or using him as a go-go-Gadget personal helicopter, you'll still appreciate the impeccable level design and nostalgic enemy roster. But NSMBW is most successful when it forces players to figure out a means to proceed forward together, even as they constantly push each other off into bottomless pits. Intentional or otherwise.When The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures was released on the Gamecube, I recall enthusiastically bringing the game over to my friends' place for some good old fashioned Gannon hunting. We never made it quite that far - mainly because a less adept player kept us sequestered in the first dungeon long enough so that he could bomb us to death - but we progressed enough for me to appreciate that unique give-and-take dynamic. While even the most ruthless FPS co-op campaigns minimize internal conflict by setting one collective goal, Four Swords Adventures and now NSMBW don't really penalize you for being a jackass. And of course, then you need to take into account the countless accidental deaths too.And as far as sidescrollers go, this could only really work with Mario anyway. The main games have always been praised for their flawless controls, and NSMBW is no exception. I can't think of any other series that can allow for such pinpoint jumping while still allowing you to constantly be running. As much as I love LittleBigPlanet, poor Sackboy wouldn't last a minute in the Mushroom Kingdom.And that trademark precision is absolutely necessary, because in this installment, there's already a natural propensity for jumping on your buddy's head. I don't know if Luigi's hiding a tractor beam under his green hat, but I just couldn't avoid stomping him into oblivion at every given opportunity. And based on anecdotal conversations with friends and my fellow podcast mates, I'm not alone in this affliction. You need to be ready to laugh off frustrations here, because NSMBW can be maddening.But for old-school Mario junkies, they may be too distracted by all of the new level gimmicks. While most of the music and stage themes are drawn completely from the DS original - a disappointment in my book - you'll be using the Wii remote to control moving platforms, pendulums, spotlights and more. These moments are especially fun when you've got another buddy on enemy patrol. Plus, you've got some rare Yoshi sightings, new suits and even a few clever boss battles in your own personal clown copter. Sometimes you'd wish that these moments would be fleshed out a bit more, but there's a reason why gamers still talk about Kuribo's legendary footwear even though it's only ever been seen in one level.On the other hand, while I'm glad to see so many enemy cameos from previous games, the familiar faces sometimes take away a sense of identity. We haven't seen Monty Mole or Rocky Wrench in ages, so their returns are welcomed by this Nintedo geek. But why didn't Miyamoto's team extend invitations to new enemies? There are a few original designs here and there, but by the end of the game, you can count them on one hand.After Super Mario World debuted, Nintendo could have pushed a sequel out in just a year or two. But instead, Miyamoto waited until the system's twilight years to create Yoshi's Island, arguably the pinnacle of the genre and host of dozens of new enemies. While Yoshi's first big outing was only a Mario game in tacked-on subtitle only, it did seem to carry the torch for the 2D games until this most recent installment. NSMBW therefore has a lot to live up to in my mind, and while the level design and four-player stuff succeed, I think that koopa nostalgia will only get you so far.These issues might bug me as I write this, but whenever I pick up the controller, these gripes tend to vanish pretty quickly. Like Yoshi's Island's red coins and Super Mario World's 96 goals, there are dozens of \"Star Coins\" that I need to go back to collect. Even without these additional goals, the unbridled joy pressed to this disc would be enough to get me to replay a dozen times over - exactly as I did with the cartridge-based Super Mario Bros. games 20 years ago.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway", "categories": ["Video Games", "Kids & Family", "Wii"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books", "Travel"], ["root",

{"asin": "B002CGT08S", "reviewText": "I would like to start out by stating this meter is free, when you receive the meter and open it up there is a rebate form to receive up to $29.99 for your purchase. Now I read some people complaining about the solution. It's quite simple you just call the customer service number and they will mail you the solution for free to test and make sure your meter is working. You will need the serial number of the meter on the back and the Lot number of the test strips that came in the box. Yes it might take a bit more time before you can use your meter but in my opinion that is very small price to pay for the fact that the meter is free and the test strips are so darn cheap!!! $19 for 100 strips!!Now I dont know why someone is saying this meter is incomplete as I have another meter my doc prescribed to me and it came with a lot less then what this product came with. I purchased this to use when I run out of strips that are covered under my insurance for the month.You will get 1 meter, 1 pricker, 10 lancets (which i have to say I love these lancets they dont hurt like my other ones \"freestyle\" ), 10 sample test strips, 1 carrying case that will hold all these items in it, and a booklet to keep track of your readings. This is a complete kit with the exception that you need to call in to have them mail you the solution. it would cost me $80 for 100 test strips with \"freestyle\" so i'm not complaining at all. This is an awesome deal and a free meter, there is nothing to complain about for the price and the customer service rep is friendly. Hope this helps you make your decision in your meter purchase!!! Good luck and stay healthy!!!!FOLLOW UP REVIEW:I NOW GIVE THIS METER 2 STARS THEN THE ORIGINAL 5 STARS. THE REASON BEING IS THAT I ALSO HAVE A FREESTYLE METER THAT IS APPROVED BY MY HEALTH INSURANCE (I GOT THIS METER TO USE WHEN I AM OUT OF STRIPS AND HAVE TO WAIT TILL I AM AVAILIBLE FOR REFILLS WITH MY MONITOR) IS TESTING ME WITH A 35 DIFFERENCE OF THE TRUE TEST MONITOR. MEANING IF I TEST 90 ON TRUE TEST FREESTYLE WILL SHOW ME AS A 125. THAT IS A MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN READINGS AND IS A BIG PROBLEM. IMAGINE IF YOU HAD DIABETES AND THIS MONITOR TESTS YOU AS HAVING 120 SO YOU THINK YOU ARE FINE WHEN IN FACT YOU ARE TRUELY 155. OR YOU TEST AT 55 THINKING YOU ARE LOW AND YOU GO FIND SOMETHNG TO EAT TO BRING IT UP A BIT BUT REALLY YOU WERE FIND BECAUSE YOU WERE TRULY 90 AND NOW YOU JUST RAISED YOUR BLOOD SUGAR! THATS AWFUL! I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MONITOR IS NOT APPROVED BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY. AND I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS A 30 POINT LEEWAY ON THE TEST STRIP BOTTLE WHEN YOU ARE CHECKING WITH THE FAKE BLOOD TO SEE IF THE STRIPS AND MONITOR ARE ACCURATE. NOW I GIVE IT A 2 INSTEAD OF A 1 BECAUSE YOU COULD JUST ASSUME THAT YOUR BLOOD SUGAR IS 30-35 POINTS HIGHER THEN WHAT IT READS BUT THATS STILL KIND OF IFY IN MY OPINION. BUT FOR THOSE WHO CANT AFFORD $85 FOR  50 STRIPS IT MIGHT JUST BE SOMETHING YOU WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS I.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment", "Diabetes

{"asin": "B00HVX4TM4", "reviewText": "Are you still searching for &#34;The One&#34; that will come into your life for the better, change how you view the world, and make things better? It seems impossible but Pawtec has produced a travel-size partner known as the Signature Dual USB Wall Charger that's available in the colors of white and back selling for about $18 ($17.99) plus shipping via Amazon US and special thanks to Pawtec for sending this out to review.Like always, I want to quickly recap what I received with my Product Unit, which included a Quick Start paper and the wall charger. Unlike the competition, they also included a small yet reasonable size traveling bag with the product itself. Which is a giant thumbs up to Pawtec for going up and beyond what is expected from a small yet growing business. In conclusion, Pawtec has thought of everything you need to get started while selling it for less than $35 (original price).If anything, Pawtec has always kept their products simple, elegant, and best-performing at it's fullest. Pawtec includes their logo, well colorful name, on the front which is beautiful from an average consumer point-of-view. On the back, it's plain and nothing included. Especially that annoying text that tells information that no one cares about. Psst. Pawtec hidden it on the bottom so don't worry about having a product that is so nerdy with you.The left side is simple but includes a two-prong setup in order to power it. This setup is included since I live in the United States and everything is American. All jokes aside, the right side is blank, which is perfectly fine with me.The last side that I didn't include is where the fun starts. They included two 2.1 amps port for you to charge your devices at the same time. Wait! Both USB ports are 2.1 amps and not 1.0 amps. Gasp! &#34;Things just got real.&#34; This gives you the power to charge your smartphones at the same time, your two tablets at the same time, or a smartphone and a tablet. The possibilities are endless! Pawtec has outdone the competition as of March 2014!In conclusion, Pawtec has came a long way since they started and is improving on the mistakes of their competitors and of course haters.

{"asin": "B0012N5EQE", "reviewText": "This installment in the Tomb Raider series was, for me, more demanding and much more expansive than TOMB RAIDER 2013, although that game, too, was superlative and very difficult.twists and turns of plot abounded throughout the game, but the player finally gets an idea who's behind all of the evil when he reaches the ship full of cargo labeled:  ATLA.The hardest parts of this game were the timed sequences which caused one to want to pull his hair out!The graphics, for 2008, were extremely well done, and my hat is off to EIDOS and its superb staff of engineers, testers, production people, graphics, voice and music divisions for a job done far beyond the call of duty.Lara was beautiful, as she was in TR 2013, and she could really jump, evade, grapple, swing and kill off enemies.  This game was very tastefully done, with no excessive gore or blood and no brutality.  It was done the way games should be done, and I only wish there were more Tomb Raider games available.  Right now, all I have left to play in this genre are LARA CROFT AND THE GUARDIAN OF LIGHT, which I don't care for due to camera angles and other problems which I won't get into, and TOMB RAIDER:  LEGEND.  And, although the graphics in LEGEND are all right, it seems to be missing the mystery and pizzazz of UNDERWORLD and 2013.These games (TR UNDERWORLD and TR 2013) were the greatest I have ever played, and I recommend them highly to anyone who cares to \"take the plunge.\"", "categories": ["Video Games", "PC", "Games"], "core_classes": [["root", "Video Games"], ["root", "Entertainment"], ["root", "Video Games", "Digital Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "Digital Games", "PC Game Downloads"], ["root", "Video Games", "Digital Games", "MMO & Free-to-Play Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "Digital Games", "Mac Game Downloads"], ["root", "Video Games", "Digital Games", "Casual Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Advance"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "3DO"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Color"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Gaming Keyboards"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy", "Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Advance", "Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "3DO", "Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Color", "Games"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Headsets"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Controllers"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy", "Hardware", "Consoles"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Advance", "Hardware", "Consoles"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "3DO", "Hardware", "Consoles"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Color", "Hardware", "Consoles"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy", "Hardware", "Accessories"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Advance", "Hardware", "Accessories"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "3DO", "Hardware", "Accessories"], ["root", "Video Games", "More Systems", "Game Boy Color", "Hardware", "Accessories"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Controllers", "Joysticks"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Controllers", "Guitars"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Controllers", "Drums"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Controllers", "Steering Wheels"], ["root", "Video Games", "Mac", "Accessories", "Controllers", "Flight Controls"]]}

The GelPro is very well made, no question, and the decorative choices are many. But the temp no-brand mat we purchased first is actually thicker and a bit softer. The GelPro is comfortable but feels a bit harder. Some people may like this firmer GelPro mat and may find that the thicker cheapy models are too... er... squishy, for lack of a better term.Overall the GelPro is a well-made quality mat, but just not soft enough to garner a full star rating.

If anything, the problem is that the Sleep key is right next to the Function activator, so you may mis-strike and accidentally hibernate the system. But again that has never happened to me; just pay attention.A white keyboard means two things: (1) it'll get dirty; and (2) the keys won't fade as it does on the black ones. Since dirt can be removed but faded-out black plastic can't be revarnished, I always choose white keyboards over black ones (and if you think that's racist, you've got a problem!).Please, Logitech, bring these back onto the market!

{"asin": "B0063705PE", "reviewText": "I bought this antenna for a friend in the apparently mistaken belief that the FlatWave had to be an improvement over her ancient rabbit ears. First disappointment -- I discovered that the FlatWave is ideally taped (2 pieces of double sided tape are supplied) to the inside surface of a window precisely facing the transmitter tower. So how many people are equipped with a window adjacent to their TV and facing in just the right direction? Not many, would be my guess, and of course my friend's apartment did not fit the bill. So I had to improvise. There was a wall behind the TV that was oriented about 10 degrees from optimal. The FlatWave does not come with any sort of integrated mounting system (another shortcoming), and I wasn't going to tape it to the wall, but I jury rigged a pretty good solution and got it up there. Long story short, it worked, but her favorite channel was nowhere to be seen. What to do? The antenna is clearly directional, but how to re-orient something resembling a flimsy dinner table placemat that wants to be taped to a flat rigid surface? Purely as a test, I was able to temporarily point it directly at the tower, but that pesky channel was still weaker than the reception she got with an old pair of rabbit ears! Those rabbit ears were much easier to place, required no tape, and didn't mind being moved around a bit until digital reception was better than a brand new flat miracle of modern science. I returned it. )-8", "categories": ["Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories"], "core_classes": [["root", "Purchase Circles"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies"], ["root", "Purchase Circles", "Geography"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Television Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Analog-to-Digital (DTV) Converters"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Portable & Novelty TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "OLED TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Satellite TV Equipment"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "TV Accessories & Parts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Televisions", "Plasma TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Radios", "Personal Radios"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Telephone Accessories", "Wireless Jack Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Mounts", "Computer & Monitor Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Mounts", "Speaker Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Cable Sleeves"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Cable Straps"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Mounts", "Projector Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Cable Ties"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Cord Management", "Cord Reels"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Antennas", "TV Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Antennas", "Radio Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "TV Accessories & Parts", "TV Ceiling & Wall Mounts"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Satellite TV Equipment", "Mounting Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "TV Accessories & Parts", "TV Screen Protectors"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "TV Accessories & Parts", "TV Turntables"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "TV Accessories & Parts", "Rear Projection TV Replacement Lamps"], ["root", "Electronics", "Accessories & Supplies", "Audio & Video Accessories", "Satellite TV Equipment", "Mounting Accessories", "Satellite Dish Mounts"]]}
{"asin": "B00005LOPR", "reviewText": "The music that Dragonlord play is perhaps best described as \"blackened thrash\" in that it is equally influenced by black metal than it is by thrash. Indeed, the vocals (skin crawling rasps) and lyrics almost seem to have \"black metal\" written all over them, and there are just enough black metal-derived keyboards mixed in, too, thus helping to make the musical arrangements sound even fuller. But featuring two members of Testament (Eric Peterson and Steve Smyth), Dragonlord also have strong, undeniable roots in the latter of the two genres, too. And they fill their songs with thrash and speed metal riffs. Other genres they fuse-into their sound include power metal and melodic death metal. And even some Nineties-era grind elements find their way into the mix in some of the songs. Or, in other words, DL, and their 2001 debut, \"Rapture,\" take some of Testament's more technical riffs (from that band's 1999 era), and mix it with black metal vocals/lyrics, symphonic flourishes, decent bass lines (the band are blessed to have tapped the skills of Sadus bass virtuoso Steve DiGiorgio, even if he goes unnoticed most of the time), and tight, brutal drumming. So, think \"The Gathering\"-era Testament mixed with Immortal, Dimmu Borgir, Metallica, Suffocation, At The Gates, Iron Maiden, Morbid Angel, Death, and Goatwhore.After \"Vals De La Muerte\" (a surprisingly calm and atmospheric, symphonic black metal-derived instrumental intro), the album really gets underway with \"Unholyvoid,\" which greets the listener like a freight train, with its blistering, rip-roaring thrash riffage. Some symphonic black metal elements do remain, here, as there is a full-orchestra present; but it, while audible, is pushed to the back of the mix. The vocals, meanwhile, are classic black metal; and the drumming in this song is noteworthy, too, as it is deft and thunderous throughout. But for the most part, this is the guitarists show -- Peterson and Smyth definitely have talents aplenty, and they show them off by dominating the maelstrom, here, with smoke-inducing twin-guitar dogfights and fiery solos that rip the air. So while the song might be vaguely symphonic, but it is for the most part brutal and thrashy. And the tune's symphonic outro flows perfectly into the next track's intro; but things soon slam into blazing, rock-hard thrash riffs, again. As such, \"Tradition And Fire\" practically screams \"vintage symphonic black metal\" (much in the same vein as Cradle Of Filth and Dimmu Borgir) in that perfectly balances ambiance with pure, thrashing brutality. The number is also of note for featuring a great crescendo -- it ascends from a hooky, hoof-pounding thrash gallop (a la Nevermore) to explosive, whiplash-inducing grindcore territory at the drop of a hat. \"T&F;\" also sprinkles in some tasteful synth flourishes, thus helping to lend the arrangements some nice texture and depth.Despite featuring a symphonic intro, \"Born To Darkness\" is a steady beating that rocks as hard as ever, as a heads-down, frills-free thrash romp with fiery, chug and churn riffs. Still, this is a much more mid-tempo cut than the three that preceded it, and it even features some clean, nearly spoken-word vocals. And plus, a totally ripping melodic solo is slipped in, here, for good measure, as well. But immediately following it, \"Rapture\" returns to its full-fledged brutal roots, as a scorching, ripping thrash melee of impeccable, frenetic, head-rattling blast beats and bullying riffs. But \"Judgment Failed,\" while brutal, also injects some perfectly-placed symphonic music elements, thus helping to add a bit of nuance to the mix, and allowing the listener to catch a fleeting breath or two. All told, the end result is a tune that is easy to imagine Immortal (et al) nodding in approval while listening to it.Next up is another tasteful bludgeon in the form of \"Wolfhunt,\" which tears the listener's head clean off with a frantic, dissonant onslaught of fiery pick slides, warp speed riffing, grumbling bass lines, and wild, blasting drums that evoke pure grindcore. But aside from featuring some grinding blasts, this song is mostly a throwback to classic, Slayer-esque Eighties thrash. And so is \"Spirits In The Mist\" -- at least for the most part. See, it is backed by strong, churning, and sometimes almost buzzsaw-fast speedster riffage; but its raspy vocals and outlandish lyricism are both very heavily influenced by straight-up black metal. Finally, the set comes to a close with \"Rapture,\" which is highlighted by a memorable, mazy soloing section (complete with tasty sweep picking).It might not warrant getting a five-star rating from yours truly, because the inclusion of a couple of more excellent, eargasmic guitar solos would have been nice. But even so, this album is one of the best debuts of the new millennium, best extreme metal releases of 2001, and a record that already cements Dragonlord's status as being one of the best extreme metal supergroups of the decade. As memorable as it is potent and brutal, \"Rapture\" is a no-brainer for all fans of black metal and thrash.", "categories": ["CDs & Vinyl", "Metal", "Pop Metal"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"],

{"asin": "B001DYC0CS", "reviewText": "Ok. I recently got a D90 and had bought the 55-200 Nikon lens with it. But I wanted to get a good walk around lens for an upcoming trip through CA & NV. So I finalized the Nikon 18-200 (5 yr warranty) & Tamron 18-270 (6 yr warranty). I had to eliminate the Sigma (1yr warranty) due to significant number of users having their lens go bad in 2-12 months.I bought the Tamron from Amazon last week hoping to keep it or return it for the 18-200 Nikon if there were significant problems. I find that after 400 photos, I see excellent photos and great Vibration Compensation (VR or VRII on Nikon). On low light (maybe 1 candle light equivalent) it takes a tad longer (extra 2-3 seconds) to focus, but I can't comment about it unless I can compare against the Nikon 18-200.However I compared the Tamron against the 55-200 Nikon that I already have and whenever the Tamron struggled to autofocus, so did the Nikon under the same parameters. At improved lighting, the Tamron was better than 55-200. The Tamron did better than the Nikon 18-55mm too in similar lighting. I know I cannot extrapolate these results to the Nikon 18-200, but I have to wait until I can borrow it from my friend to compare.Compared to the Nikon being another three-hundred&fifty; more, I don't know if it is that much better.I'm very impressed with the build quality of the Tamron lens. Seems well made. I like the autofocus locking speed and pic quality is crisp in most lighting conditions,zoom, shutter & aperture settings. The motor is slightly more noisier than nikon lens, but it does not even bother me. I think is is something that will bother someone who really wants to find fault with this lens. I do feel that people with D90 & D300 have great experiences with this lens while d80 and d200 and older bodies, people complain. So maybe that might be a factor in less stars? I have another 28 days more to evaluate this lens or exchange for the Nikon. I will come back and edit this review if I find anything to the contrary. But so far it is a great buy and looks like a keeper. I reviewed thousands of pictures in pbase & flickr before I felt this lens even merited a try and so far hasn't failed to impress me.2009-Nov-14: Its been almost 2 weeks with the Tamron. I also purchased a Nikon 18-200 from Amazon hoping to keep one of them. There is lens creep in both the Nikon and the Tamron. I took a few pictures in low light of the same subject, hand held, VR/VC ON @ 200mm, 0.63 secs exposure, ISO 1600. f5.6 on Nikon & f6.3 on Tamron. I did a side by side compare in Paintshop at 60% zoom of the 4288x2848 image and I see the Tamron has better details, sharpness. The setting was indoors with two 3 w bulbs about 10 feet away at night. I have to try the same on a tripod though. I'm thinking why not spend the money saved when buying a Tamron (almost three-thirty as of today) towards a high speed lens for specialized night shooting if/when needed and/or a Nikon SB-600 flash. So far I like the Tamron. I'm an amateur, but comparing pics side by side with the two lenses is slowly convincing me to keep the Tamron. Will update again if I find anything more to add.Of course be sure to read the reviews at DPReview for both lenses where they rate the Nikon slightly better. Also look at pics taken at pbase & flickr for the lenses.Dec 31, 2009: I finally went with the Nikon 18-200 in Nov before my vacation just because I wasn't sure about the Tamron's performance in low lighting and if it will bite me if I end up taking some low light pics. Looking back though, I feel like I should have stayed with my Tamron and netted the difference in money and enjoyed! :-( I looked at some older pics taken by Tamron when I first bought it and one thing I really liked was the bokeh in closeup pics. It is very smooth compared to the Nikon 18-200. I for one usually hunt for value in any product and in this I might have not done so by not sticking with the Tamron. I highly recommend this lens.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Camera & Photo", "Lenses"], "core_classes": [["root", "Books"], ["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Books", "Travel"], ["root", "Books",
