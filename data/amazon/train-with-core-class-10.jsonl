{"asin": "B005CLPP84", "reviewText": "This is our second Roku after getting an XD. The differences in the Roku 2 are: the cheapest is 720p wireless only, the next expensive is 1080p wireless only and the top of the line XS is 1080p wired/wireless with memory for games and a gaming remote. All use HDMI to connect to your TV. Our first was the Roku 2 XD, the middle of the line that is wireless with 1080p and it took only a week to decide to buy another. We use them daily. There is a good mixture of free and low cost content available to watch on them. HBO GO's addition means we no longer have to feel left out for having Satellite (Dish) and no On Demand like cable has. The same with EpixHD, we have Dish Network and subscribe to Epix so we have access to their movies and even the channel live on the Roku 2. Crackle is a free channel on the Roku, owned by Sony it features uncut movies from DVD to HD quality. The biggest reason we got the Roku was to access Amazon Prime HD movies, you can't do that on the web via a computer, they are only in SD. Of course Hulu Plus and NetFlix are also included channels on the Roku.Because one of our TVs didn't have enough HDMI inputs, I got an inexpensive HDMI switch. The one I got was like this one, Ultra High Performance HDMI Switcher, 3to1 SwitchProsGreat content, increasing all the time...recently HBO GO was added, check their website for current lineupLots of free contentLots of low cost contentVery small sizeEasy to installGreat Customer ServiceDepending on the Roku channel/your internet service, great picture qualityConsYou have to have a decent internet connection to get the most of it. Although it will lower theresolution of the picture for slower connections. I would think a 3.0 mbps connection would be fine. To stream the highest level of HD Netflix, you need a 9mbps connection, like you need for the top VuDu offerings.Not all channels have closed captionsSome Internet providers have data caps and you could run overTo upgrade one of the lower models to gaming, the remote and memory card are $30, pricy.", "categories": ["Electronics", "Television & Video", "Streaming Media Players"], "core_classes": [["root", "Movies & TV"], ["root", "Electronics"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video"], ["root", "Movies & TV", "Movies"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video"], ["root", "Electronics", "Electronics Warranties"], ["root", "Movies & TV", "TV"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Television Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Streaming Media Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Home Theater Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Portable DVD Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Portable & Novelty TVs"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Receivers"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Satellite Dishes"], ["root", "Electronics", "Television & Video", "Satellite Television", "Antennas"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Players"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Stands"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Remote Controls"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "FM Transmitters"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Speaker Systems"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Cases"], ["root", "Electronics", "Portable Audio & Video", "MP3 Players & Accessories", "MP3 Player Accessories", "Docking Stations"]]}
